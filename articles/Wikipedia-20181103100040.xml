      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9876">'''Fancy pigeons''' are a type of [[domestic pigeon]]s, which are [[Domestication|domesticated]] varieties of the wild [[rock dove]] (''Columba livia''). They are bred by [[Pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]] for various traits relating to size, shape, color, and behavior,&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, South Carolina|isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who often exhibit their birds at pigeon shows, fairs and other [[Livestock show|livestock exhibits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird. | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007 | location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book_details.php?isbn=9780702236419| isbn =978-0-7022-3641-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] is known to have crossbred fancy pigeons, particularly the [[Ice Pigeon]], to study variation within species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=John|title=Darwin's Pigeons|url=http://darwinspigeons.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; this work coming three years before his groundbreaking publication, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.

==Pigeon showing==
[[File:Philoperisteron_society.jpg|thumb|Pigeon breeds on display (1864)]]
Pigeon fanciers from many different countries exhibit their birds at local, inter-state or national shows and compete against one another for prizes.&lt;ref name="Levi"/&gt; One typical country show in Australia in 2008 had hundreds of pigeons on display and prizes for the winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the Philoperisteron Society conducted annual shows in the mid 1800s. There were also a London Columbarian Society. The extensive variations in the breeds attracted the attention of [[Charles Darwin]] and played a major role in developing ideas on evolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://darwinspigeons.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secord, James A. (1981) Nature's Fancy: Charles Darwin and the Breeding of Pigeons Isis 72(262):162-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fanciers organize exhibitions exclusively for pigeons; one held in [[Blackpool]] run by the [[Royal Pigeon Racing Association]] is annually attended by about 25,000 people and generates around £80,000 profit, which is donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The largest pigeon show is held in [[Nuremberg]]: the German National Pigeon Show, which had over 33,500 pigeons at the 2006 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Child | first =Brad | title ="Pigeon Pals Tour" Part II | newspaper =Purebred Pigeon (March/April 2007) | pages =71, 72. | year =2007 | date =

In the United States, there are hundreds of local, state and national pigeon clubs that sponsor shows. The largest shows are the National Young Bird Show, held in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in October, and the National Pigeon Association's Grand National, held in a different city each year and usually in January.

==Major breed families==
This grouping system is adapted from ''Australian Fancy Pigeons National Book of Standards''.&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;Seymour, Rev. Colin (Ed)(2006) ''Australian Fancy Pigeons National Book of Standards''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration was given to the new UK standards book which followed the German and European grouping. This version differs slightly from that of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130415154727/http://www.entente-ee.com/deutsch/sparten/tauben/Dateien/2012/ELRT%2011-06-2012.pdf European grouping]; the following system is arbitrary and used solely for organizing breed articles until a grouping can be accepted worldwide.

===Asian feather and voice pigeons===
[[File:Fantail(silver barred).jpg|right|thumb|150px|A Fantail attempting to make itself appear larger]]

The '''long-tailed chinchilla''' (''Chinchilla lanigera''), also called the '''Chilean''', '''coastal''', '''common chinchilla''', or '''lesser chinchilla''', is one of two species of [[rodent]]s from the genus ''[[Chinchilla]]'', the other species being ''[[Chinchilla chinchilla]]''.&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Hystricognathi | id = 13400134 | page = 1550}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild populations of ''C. lanigera'' occur in Aucó, near Illapel, IV Región, [[Chile]] (31°38’S, 71°06’W), in [[Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas]] and in La Higuera, about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} north of Coquimbo (29°33’S, 71°04’W)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jiménez | first = J.E. | title = The extirpation and current status of wild chinchillas (''Chinchilla lanigera'' and ''C. brevicaudata'') | journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 77 | pages = 1–6 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3207(95)00116-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chilean chinchillas were reported from Talca (35°30’S), Chile, reaching north to [[Peru]]&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the Chinchillidae, a family of herbivorous Rodentia, and on a new genus referrible [sic] to it|journal=Transactions of the Zoological Society of London|year=1835|first=E.T.|last=Bennett|volume=1|issue=|pages=35–64|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1835.tb00602.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eastward from Chilean coastal hills throughout low mountains. By the mid-19th century, Chilean chinchillas were not found south of the [[Choapa River]].

No [[fossil]]s are known.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:TurboHome.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A domesticated long-tailed chinchilla]]
''Chinchilla lanigera'' is smaller (wild animals have body lengths up to {{convert|260|mm|abbr=on}}), has more rounded ears, ({{convert|45|mm|abbr=on}} in length), and longer tails than ''C. chinchilla''; its tail is usually about a third the size of its body (up to {{convert|130|mm|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} in ''C. chinchilla''). The number of [[caudal vertebrae]] is 23 in ''C. lanigera'', and 20 in ''C. chinchilla''). Males typically weigh {{convert|369|–|493|g|abbr=on}} (mean: {{convert|412|g|abbr=on}}) and females weigh {{convert|379|-|450|g|abbr=on}} (mean: {{convert|422|g|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=Spotorno&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chinchilla laniger|journal=Mammalian Species|date=15 December 2004|first=Angel E.|last=Spotorno|author2=Zuleta, C.A. |author3=Valladares, J.P. |author4=Deane, A.L. |author5=Jiménez, J.E.  |volume=758|issue=|pages=1–9|doi=10.1644/758}} [http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/758_Chinchilla_laniger.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205060715/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/758_Chinchilla_laniger.pdf |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticated animals are larger than wild ones and more [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], with the female weighing up to {{convert|800|g|abbr=on}} and males up to {{convert|600|g|abbr=on}}.

The word ''lanigera'' translates into "bearing a woolen coat", yet chinchillas do not have a woolen coat, but instead one consisting of hair. Their hair is {{convert|2|–|4|cm|abbr=on}} long, with gray, white, and black bands; it is silky, extremely soft, and firmly adhered to the skin.&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt; Up to 75 hairs, {{convert|5|–|11|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, emerge together from a single hair follicle. [[Vibrissa]]e (whiskers) are abundant, strong, long ({{convert|100|–|130|mm|abbr=on}}), and emerge from single [[hair follicle|follicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Histology of the skin and hair of the adult chinchilla|journal=Anatomical Record|year=1950|first=H. N.|last=Wilcox|volume=108|issue=|pages=385–397|pmid=14799877 |url=|accessdate=|doi=10.1002/ar.1091080304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general color of their upper parts is bluish or silvery gray; the underparts are yellowish-white. The tail has long, coarse, gray and black hairs on its dorsal surface, {{convert|30|–|40|mm|abbr=on}} long near the body, {{convert|50|–|60|mm|abbr=on}} long near the tip, and form a bristly tuft that exceeds vertebrae by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Bennett" /&gt;

In the wild, they breed between October and December, which are the spring months in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Spotorno" /&gt;

Its [[karyotype]] has [[Diploid|2n]] = 64 and [[Fundamental number|FN]] = 126.&lt;ref name = MSW3 /&gt;

== Varieties ==

Three different types of ''C.&amp;nbsp;lanigera'' are commonly recognized: ''la plata, costina'', and ''raton''.&lt;ref name=Bickel&gt;{{Cite book|first=Edmund|last=Bickel|title=Chinchilla Handbook|publisher=T.F.H. Publications, Inc.|place=Neptune City, NJ|year=1987|isbn=0-86622-494-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''la plata'' type has better-developed musculature and heavier bone structure than the other two types. The typical ''la plata'' looks more roundish or compact, with a short, wide head, a large distance from one ear to another, and a relatively straight dorsal line. The shoulders are often as wide as the chest and rump. The ears are short and nearly round.

[[File:Chinchilla lanigera reared.jpg|left|thumb|Chinchilla ''costina'' standing on its hind legs]]
The ''costina'' type is weaker in musculature and bone structure, with the most distinctive feature being the longer hind legs. The fore legs are shorter and placed closer together, and the shoulders are narrower. The vertebral column is more arched; the neck line is sometimes very deep, forming a slight hump on the back of the animal. When viewed directly from the front, the head is V-shaped, the nose is pointed, and the distance between the ears is rather wide. The ears are long and positioned at an angle around 45°.

The ''raton'' type is reminiscent of the ''la plata'' type in its body structure. The nose is pointed as in the ''costina'', and the ears are positioned very close together and rather horizontal; it is distinctively smaller, on average.

== Ecology ==
[[Image:RunningChin.jpg|left|thumb|Running chinchilla]]
Climate in the chinchillas' habitat is rather harsh, with summer temperatures climbing during the day to up to 30&amp;nbsp;°C in the shade and dropping to 7&amp;nbsp;°C at night (or below the freezing point in winter).&lt;ref name="Spotorno" /&gt;

== Conservation status ==
The Chilean chinchilla is [[endangered]], with the second-highest conservation priority among Chilean mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cofré | first1 = H. | last2=Marquet| first2=P.A.| title = Conservation status, rarity, and geographic priorities for conservation of Chilean mammals: an assessment| journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 88| pages = 53–68 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3207(98)00090-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pack Horse 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for lead image--&gt;|[[Packhorse|Horse packing]] with traditional Australian [[pack saddle]]]]

A '''pack animal''' or '''beast of burden''' is an individual or type of [[working animal]] used by [[human]]s as means of [[transport]]ing materials by attaching them so their weight bears on the [[animal]]'s back, in contrast to draft animals which pull loads but do not carry them.

Traditional pack animals are diverse including [[camel]]s, [[pack goat|goat]]s, [[domestic yak|yak]]s, [[reindeer]], [[water buffalo]]es, and [[llama]]s as well as the more familiar pack animals like [[packhorse|horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s.

The term ''pack animal'' is traditionally used in contrast to ''draft animal'', which is a [[working animal]] that typically pulls a load behind itself (such as a [[plow]], a cart, a [[sled]] or a heavy log) rather than carrying cargo directly on its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Right to be Outside: Three Mules |url=http://www.notechmagazine.com/category/pack-animals |publisher=No Tech Magazine |date=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[sled dog]]s pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants have been used for centuries to haul logs out of forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elephants in Logging Operations in Sri Lanka |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9570e/v9570e02.htm |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=31 January 2016 |archiveurl=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9570e/v9570e02.htm |archivedate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pack animals may be fitted with [[pack saddle]]s and may also carry [[saddlebag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Much Weight Can My Horse Carry? |url=https://www.outfitterssupply.com/russon/how-much-weight.asp |publisher=Outfitters Supply |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditional usage of pack animals by nomadic tribespeople is declining, a new market is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the [[High Atlas]] mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of [[backpacking with animals]].&lt;ref name=DonkeySanctuary/&gt;  The use of pack animals "is considered a valid means of viewing and experiencing" some [[National Park]]s in America, subject to guidelines and closed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Horse &amp; Pack Animal Use |url=http://www.nps.gov/care/planyourvisit/horsepack.htm |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, [[special forces]] have received guidance on the use of horses, mules, llamas, camels, dogs, and elephants as pack animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FM 3-05.213 (FM 31-27) Special Forces  Use of Pack Animals |url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-213.pdf |publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army |accessdate=26 January 2016 |date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Load carrying capacity==

The load for oxen is their body weight (1500-2500 pounds) at walking pace and 2X for short hauls. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lancasterfarming.com/news/northern_edition/oxen-no-has-beens-when-it-comes-to-hard-pulling/article_b79a5f8f-5d4b-578d-997a-f385095dc7c9.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum load for a camel is roughly 300&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=CSIRO |title=Model Code of Practice for the  Welfare of Animals The Camel (Camelus dromedarius) |date=2006 |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |page=8 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/Books/download.cfm?ID=5204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaks are loaded differently according to region. In Sichuan, 75&amp;nbsp;kg is carried for 30&amp;nbsp;km in 6 hours. In Qinghai, at 4100 m altitude, packs of up to 300&amp;nbsp;kg are routinely carried, while up to 390&amp;nbsp;kg is carried by the heaviest steers for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draught performance|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad347e/ad347e0g.htm|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Llamas can carry roughly 1/4 of their body weight, so an adult male of 200&amp;nbsp;kg can carry some 50&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Llamas and Alpacas |url=http://www.touchtheearthranch.com/llamaFAQ.htm |publisher=Touch the Heart Ranch |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loads for equids are disputed. The US Army specifies a maximum of 20 percent of body weight for mules walking up to 20 miles a day in mountains, giving a load of up to about 150&amp;nbsp;kg. However an 1867 text mentioned a load of up to 800 pounds (about 360&amp;nbsp;kg). In India, the prevention of cruelty rules (1965) limit mules to 200&amp;nbsp;kg and ponies to 70&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bonner |first1=Laurie |title=How Much Weight Can Your Horse Safely Carry? |url=http://equusmagazine.com/article/weight_carry_062608 |publisher=Equus Magazine |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reindeer can carry up to 40&amp;nbsp;kg for a prolonged period in mountains.&lt;ref name="Nickul1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nickul|first=Karl |title=The Lappish Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fjwc3OoDdV4C&amp;pg=PA29 |year=1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-7007-0922-9 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breed type''' is the whole of the characteristics that are typical of a [[breed]] of [[Domestication|domesticated animals]]. Breed type may include details of form or color that are not directly related to the economic value of the animal, and are usually defined in [[breed standard]]s.

== Examples ==
"Examples [of ''breed type''] include the shape of horns and the color pattern in cattle, the shape of ear in swine, and the color of the face and shape of the ear in sheep" and are "in a sense, a trademark".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ideal-alpaca.com/article/alpaca-breed-type-162.htm A Comparative Analysis Of Alpaca Breed Type And Standards, by Mike Safley, Jude Anderson, Maggie Krieger, Retrieved on 14 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

''Breed type'' in this sense means "qualities (as of bodily contour and carriage) that are felt to indicate excellence in members of a group" &lt;ref&gt;Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged. 1967 Springfield, MA U.S.A.: G&amp;C Merriam Company, pg 2476.&lt;/ref&gt; and is different from a ''type of animal'', meaning a variety or breed of domesticated animal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11919">'''Self-domestication''' is the process of adaptation of wild animals to humans, without direct human selective breeding of the animals. The biological processes in the evolution of humans and human culture are also referred to by the term "self-domestication".

==In animals==
Wild animals may ''self-domesticate'' when tame behaviour enhances their survival in the vicinity of human beings. Tolerating or even enjoying the close proximity of humans in order to feed near them, and a lessening of natural adult aggression, are two aspects of tameness. An environment that supports the survival of tame animals can lead to other changes in behaviour and appearance as well.

Smaller skulls on tame animals have been noticed in other species. Noticing that a dog's skull looks like that of a juvenile wolf, [[Richard Wrangham]] goes on to say that "this leads to the thought that species can self-domesticate."&lt;ref name="Wrangham" /&gt; Other characteristics that are associated with juvenility such as barking and meowing (sounds used by wolf cubs and kittens of large felines, respectively, to communicate with their parents), increased playfulness and reduced aggression, may also be seen in tame animals.

===Cats===
Self-domestication is described by biological anthropologist [[Richard Wrangham]] as being in an environment where lessening of aggression was beneficial for survival.&lt;ref name="Wrangham"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Humanists: Science at the Edge |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Brockman |chapter=The Evolution of Cooking |chapterurl={{Google books|Fb0EGAq5UmcC|page=99|plainurl=yes}} |first1=Richard |last1=Wrangham |pages=99–110 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7607-4529-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As grain plants and livestock became domesticated 9,000 years ago in the [[Fertile Crescent]], wild [[cat]]s adapted to living with humans, hunting rodents in grain stores and "abandoning their aggressive wild-born behaviors", which led to today's house cats.&lt;ref name="SciencemagNEO"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1139518 |pmid=17600185 |title=The Near Eastern Origin of Cat Domestication |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5837 |pages=519–23 |year=2007 |last1=Driscoll |first1=C.

W. |bibcode=2007Sci...317..519D |pmc=5612713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dogs===
{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}
While humans may have intentionally domesticated [[Wolf|wolves]] into [[dog]]s, an alternate hypothesis is that wolves effectively domesticated themselves by establishing a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutually beneficial]] relationship with prehistoric humans. They scavenged on the remains of the prey animals left by the prehistoric people at the human settlements or the kill sites. Those wolves that were less anxious and aggressive thrived, continued to follow the prehistoric humans, and colonized the human-dominated environments, generation after generation. Gradually, the first primitive dogs emerged from this group.&lt;ref name=crockford2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Crockford, S.|editor=Crockford, S.|year=2000|title=A commentary on dog evolution: Regional variation, breed development and hybridization with wolves| pages=11–20|publisher=Archaeopress BAR International Series 889|isbn=978-1841710891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coppinger2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Coppinger, R.|year=2001|title=Dogs: A Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior &amp; Evolution|isbn=0684855305}}{{pn|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=russell2012&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell, N.|year=2012|title=Social Zooarchaeology: Humans and Animals in Prehistory| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14311-0}}{{pn|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foxes===
Research done beginning in 1959 by the Soviet geneticist [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] on [[Tame Silver Fox|silver foxes]] [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] only for tameness revealed that a whole range of other physical and behavioural features, such as [[neoteny]], also appeared along with the tameness, characteristics that were not specifically the result of selective breeding by humans. White spots on their fur, floppy ears, rolled tails and smaller skulls were seen in the tame foxes, and the foxes were also described as "incredibly endearing."&lt;ref name=rats&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|title=Nice Rats, Nasty Rats: Maybe It’s All in the Genes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/25/health/25rats.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=25 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belyayev and his successors also [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] wild rats for tameness, with similar results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/25/health/25rats.html?pagewanted=print Nice Rats, Nasty Rats: Maybe It’s All in the Genes] by [[Nicholas Wade]], [[New York Times]], 25 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These results with [[selective breeding]] suggest that the [[natural selection|natural process]] of self-domestication of animals can occur within a single human generation.

===Primates===
It has been argued that [[Bonobo|bonobos]] (''Pan paniscus''), relatives of the chimpanzee, have undergone self-domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.12.007 |title=The self-domestication hypothesis: Evolution of bonobo psychology is due to selection against aggression |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=573–85 |year=2012 |last1=Hare |first1=Brian |last2=Wobber |first2=Victoria |last3=Wrangham |first3=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==
Self-domestication theories describe how humans developed and evolved. The idea of self-domestication was used by early [[Social Darwinism]] which, according to psychiatrist Martin Brüne in an article "On human self-domestication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1747-5341-2-21 |pmid=17919321 |pmc=2082022 |title=On human self-domestication, psychiatry, and eugenics |journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine |volume=2 |pages=21 |year=2007 |last1=Brüne |first1=Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed from the idea that humans could perfect themselves biologically.

"Contemporary reproductive technologies such as selective abortion and [[genetic screening]] are typical examples where our self-domestication is most directly apparent," writes philosopher [[Masahiro Morioka]], who also says that "Through domesticating ourselves like cattle, people began civilization."&lt;ref&gt;''Painless Civilization: A Philosophical Critique of Desire'' by [[Masahiro Morioka]], Transview Publications, Tokyo, 2003, {{ISBN|4-901510-18-5}}, {{ISBN|978-4-901510-18-9}} (in Japanese); translation by Kenny Gundle and Masahiro Morioka on website http://www.lifestudies.org/painless01.html, accessed 28 Oct 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregory Stock]], director of the [[UCLA School of Medicine]]'s Program of Medicine, Technology and Society, describes self-domestication as a process which "... mirrors our domestication [of animals] ... we have transformed ourselves through a similar process of self-selection ... our transformation has been primarily cultural, but it has almost certainly had a biological component."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Redesigning Humans: Our Inevitable Genetic Future |first=Gregory |last=Stock |authorlink=Gregory Stock  |pages=243–244 |location= |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-618-06026-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark &amp; Henneberg argue that during the earliest stages of human evolution a more [[paedomorphic]] skull arose through self-domestication.&lt;ref name="Clark &amp; Henneberg 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/anre-2015-0009 |title=The life history of Ardipithecus ramidus: A heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation |journal=Anthropological Review |volume=78 |issue=2 |year=2015 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark &amp; Henneberg 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO - Journal of Comparative Human Biology |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej |volume=68 |pages=101–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion is based upon a comparison of the skull of [[Ardipithecus]] and chimpanzees of various ages. It was found that [[Ardipithecus ]] clustered with the infant and juvenile species. The consequent lack of a pubertal growth spurt in males of the species and the consequent growth of aggressive canine armoury was taken as evidence that [[Ardipithecus ]] evolved its paedomorphic skull through self domestication. As the authors state, comparing the species with [[Bonobos]]:

Of course ''A.ramidus'' differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex. However,the fact that A.ramidus shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in ''A.ramidus'' than what we see in bonobos.&lt;ref name="Clark &amp; Henneberg 2015"/&gt;

Further research has confirmed that [[Ardipithecus]] possessed paedomorphic cranial base angulation, position of the foramen magnum as well as vocal tract dimensions. This was interpreted as not only evidence of a change in social behavior but also a potentially early emergence of hominin vocal capability. If this thesis is correct then not only human social behavior but also language ability originally evolved through paedomorphic skull morphogenesis via the process of self-domestication.&lt;ref name="Clark &amp; Henneberg 2017"/&gt;

The most comprehensive case for human self-domestication has been proposed for the changes that account for the much later transition from robust humans such as Neanderthals or Denisovans to anatomically modern humans. Occurring between 40,000 and 25,000 years ago, this rapid neotenization has been explained as the result of cultural selection of mating partners&lt;ref name="Bednarik"&gt;Bednarik, Robert G. (2008). "The Domestication of Humans". Anthropologie. 46 (1): 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of variables lacking evolutionary benefits, such as perceived attractiveness, facial symmetry, youth, specific body ratios, skin tone or hair, none of which play any role in any other animal species. This unintentional auto-domestication, coinciding with the introduction of imagery of female sexuality, occurred simultaneously in four continents then occupied by hominins. It led to rapid changes typical for domestication, such as in cranial morphology, skeletal architecture, reduction in brain volume, to playful and exploratory behavior, and the establishment of thousands of deleterious conditions, syndromes, disorders and illnesses presumed absent in robust humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bednarik, Robert G. (2011). The Human Condition. Springer, New York, pp. 127-141. {{ISBN|978-1-4419-9352-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis effectively replaces the Replacement Hypothesis (known as "African Eve theory") and explains the relatively rapid transition as a culturally induced domestication process still continuing today. It also explains the rise of exograms and their role in selecting for competence in the use of external memory traces.

'''Ethnocynology''', is a [[neologism]] coined by [[anthropologist]] [[Bryan Cummins]] in his book ''First Nations, First Dogs: Canadian Aboriginal Ethnocynology'' (2002).  It refers to the study of [[dog]]s within their cultural contexts.  The term is not in general use.  

Cummins states that the domestic dog, despite being found in virtually all human [[society|societies]], has been ignored by anthropologists. This, he says, is because the dog is neither fully of "[[culture]]" (being essentially a domesticated [[wolf]]), nor of "nature", by virtue of that same [[domestication]] and having been molded into over 400 [[breed]]s. Nonetheless, Cummins leans towards the view that, being domestic animals, they are more "of culture" than "of nature", and culture is the domain of the anthropologist. Furthermore, different human societies have shaped the dog into precisely whatever roles people might have for the dog. Therefore, the domestic dog is worthy of anthropological attention; hence ethnocynology.

Deafness can occur in almost any breed of cat or dog. This includes both pure-breed and mixed-breed animals although there may be more prevalence in some specific breeds.&lt;ref&gt;Strain, G. M.

"The association between patterns of pigmentation and deafness in the dog has a long-documented history, with reports dating back over one hundred years. Long suspected of having a genetic basis, the search for loci with a pronounced influence in the expression of hearing loss in the dog has yet to be successful." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1746-6148-3-31|pmid=17999773|pmc=2194672|title=Heritability and complex segregation analysis of deafness in Jack Russell Terriers|journal=BMC Veterinary Research|volume=3|pages=31|year=2007|last1=Famula|first1=Thomas R|last2=Cargill|first2=Edward J|last3=Strain|first3=George M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deafness in animals can occur as either unilateral (one ear affected) or bilateral (both ears affected). This occurrence of either type of deafness seems to be relatively the same in both mixed-breed animals and pure-breed animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19192155|year=2009|author1=Cvejic|first1=D|title=Unilateral and bilateral congenital sensorineural deafness in client-owned pure-breed white cats|journal=Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine|volume=23|issue=2|pages=392–5|last2=Steinberg|first2=T.

Research as tired a significant association between deafness in dogs and the pigment genes piebald and merle.

Common misconceptions may lead potential owners to believe that deaf dogs may be more likely to have an unpleasant disposition, or that the condition implies other brain abnormalities. Many people have successfully raised and trained deaf animals. Teaching a deaf dog may present unusual challenges, but inventiveness can overcome many of them. 

For example, deaf dogs, when out on a walk, a laser pointer could be used to attract the animals attention.&lt;ref name=Wilkes1 /&gt;

'''Domestic guineafowl''', sometimes called '''pintades, pearl hen,''' or '''gleanies''', are [[poultry]] originating from [[Africa]]. They are the domesticated form of the [[helmeted guineafowl]] (''Numida meleagris'') and are related to other game birds such as the [[pheasant]]s, [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]s and [[partridge]]s. Although the timing of their domestication is unknown, there is evidence that domestic guineafowl were present in [[Greece]] by the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blench|first1=Roger|last2=MacDonald|first2=Kevin C.|title=The Origins and Development of African Livestock|date=1999|publisher=UCL|location=London|isbn=1841420182|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{listen |filename=Guineahencall.ogg |title=Guineafowl calls |description=Vocalizations of two female domestic guineafowl}}

They lay 25–30 eggs in a deep, tapering nest. Their eggs are small, dark and extremely thick-shelled. The hens have a habit of hiding their nests, and sharing it with other hens until large numbers of eggs have accumulated. The incubation period is 26–28 days, and the chicks are called "keets". As keets, they are highly susceptible to &lt;!-- some medical condition brought on by --&gt; dampness (they are indigenous to the more arid regions of Africa) and can die from following the mother through dewy grass.  After their first two to six weeks of growth, though, they can be some of the hardiest domestic land fowl.

Sexing the birds is not as simple as telling a [[rooster]] from a hen [[chicken]]. When they are adults, the helmet and wattles of the male are larger than those of the female (Guinea-hen), and only the female makes the two-note cry imitated as "Buck-wheat!" or "Pot-rack!" while the male only has a one-note cry. Aside from that, though, the two sexes are mostly identical in appearance.

As domestics, guineafowl are valuable pest controllers, eating many [[insect]]s. They are especially beneficial in controlling the [[Lyme disease]]-carrying deer [[tick]], as well as [[wasp]] nests. While they are rarely kept in large numbers, a few are sometimes kept with other [[fowl]] to be used as a security system against [[bird of prey|birds of prey]]. They will call with their loud, high shrieking voices if concerned about intruders.  They are highly social birds and tend to languish when alone.

Within the domesticated species, many color variations have been bred forth aside from the "pearl" or natural color of the helmeted guinea. These include white, purple, slate, chocolate, lavender, coral blue, bronze, pewter, buff dundotte, blonde, and various pieds.

It can be cooked using any recipe that calls for [[chicken]], but is considered to be more flavorful and, because of its higher cost, is generally served at special occasions. It is particularly common in [[French cuisine|French]] and [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] recipes.

'''Showa''' is a variety of ornamental [[koi]] ([[carp]]).  The Showa is also known as the {{nihongo|Showa Sanshoku|昭和三色}}.  The Showa has a black (sumi) body, with red (hi) and white (shiro) markings across the body.  The Showa is one of the gosanke; the ‘Big Three’, consisting of Kohaku, Sanke, and Showa.

Showa were originally developed by Jukichi Hoshino about 1927.  He paired a Kohaku and a Ki-Utsuri.  These early Showas had a greyish shiro and striped fins. The sumi (black) was dull and the hi was weak.  Later, Showa were bred to Asagi which helped produce the black motoguro markings in the fins. However, the hi was still weak and pale.  In 1964 Tomiji Kobayashi crossed a male Kohaku with a female Showa to produce a new style Showa with a large crimson red pattern. It also had a brighter white ground without netting.  However, the Kobayashi Showa still suffered from small size and poor body shape.  A major leap forward came as a result of a spectacular (for its time) inazuma (lightning pattern) showa bred by Minoru Mano. The inazuma showa represented a huge improvement in body conformation and overall color quality, and it was used as a brood fish for many years after.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpks.org/articles/RayJordan/KoiHistory5.shtml Ray Jordan Koi History&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Portal|Aquarium Fish}}
'''Flowerhorn [[cichlid]]s''' are ornamental [[aquarium]] fish noted for their vivid colors and the distinctively shaped heads for which they are named. Their head protuberance, or ''kok'', is formally termed a "[[nuchal lines|nuchal]] hump." Like [[blood parrot cichlid]]s, they are [[Cichlid#Hybrids and selective breeding|man-made hybrids]] that exist in the wild only because of their [[Fishkeeping#Invasive species|release]]. First developed in [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Taiwan]], they became very popular with Asian [[fishkeeping|fish hobbyists]]. They are also kept by hobbyists in the US and Europe, but their importation is banned in Australia. Some cichlid hobbyists{{who|date=October 2015}} have questioned the impact of flowerhorn breeding programs and their impact on the health and reproduction of the animals, and on natural fish species.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Origin ==

Flowerhorn breeding dates from 1993.&lt;ref name=craze&gt;[http://www.flowerhorncraze.com/Flowerhorn-101-t43104.html ''Flowerhorn 101, A Guide to Flowerhorn Strains and Types.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093706/http://www.flowerhorncraze.com/Flowerhorn-101-t43104.html |date=March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysians admired fish with protruding heads, known as ''Kaloi'' or "warships," found in the western part of the nation. The slightly protruding forehead and long tail of these fish were prized in Taiwanese society as bringing luck in [[geomancy]]. By 1994, [[Amphilophus labiatus|red devil cichlids]] (typically ''[[Amphilophus labiatus]]'') and trimac cichlids (''[[Amphilophus trimaculatus]]'') had been imported from [[Central America]] to Malaysia and the hybrid [[blood parrot cichlid]] had been imported from Taiwan to Malaysia and bred these fish together, marking the birth of the flowerhorn.{{Dubious|date=October 2009}}

In 1995, the blood parrots were further crossbred with the ''Human Face Red God of Fortune'', which produced a new breed called the ''Five-Colors God of Fortune''.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; With its beautiful colors, this fish quickly became popular. Selective breeding continued through 1998, when the ''Seven-Colors Blue Fiery Mouth'' (also known as ''Greenish Gold Tiger'') was imported from Central America, and crossbred with the ''Jin Gang Blood Parrot'' from Taiwan.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; This crossbreeding led to the first generation of ''Hua Luo Han'' flowerhorn hybrids, which were then followed by subsequent flowerhorn introductions.

=== Arrival in the West ===

When ''Luo Hans'' were first imported to the United States, there were only two breeds of these fish for distribution, flowerhorn and golden base.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; Flowerhorns came in two varieties, those with pearls (silver-white spots on the skin) and those without. Golden bases also had two varieties, those that faded and those that did not. Among the flowerhorns, the ones without pearls were quickly overtaken in popularity by those with pearls, becoming pearl scale flowerhorns, or ''Zhen Zhu''. With the golden bases, the unfaded ones developed an attractive golden skin in place of what had been the flowerhorn’s grey skin.

As of 1999, there were four strains of flowerhorn available in the American market: regular flowerhorns, pearl scale flowerhorns, golden flowerhorns, and faders.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; Commercial breeders proliferated, and fish were selected for appearance with little regard for terminology.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; Consequently, names became confusing and parentage became difficult to track.

Around 2000–2001, the ''Kamfa'' variety appeared. These were hybrids of any type of flowerhorn crossed with any species of the genus ''[[Vieja]]'' or with any parrot cichlid.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; These brought in some new traits, such as short mouths, wrapped tails, sunken eyes, and increasingly larger head bumps. Seeing this, those who bred the ''Zhen Zhus'' began line breeding their fish to develop faster and become more colorful, in order to compete with the ''Kamfa'' strains.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

==In captivity==
[[File:Determine flowerhorn sex.jpg|thumb|upright|Comparison of male and female flowerhorn anatomy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thaifh.com/flowerhorn-guides.html|title = Guides to flowerhorn sex and breeding|date = May 1, 2015|access-date = Feb 5, 2016|website = Flowerhorn guide book|publisher = www.thaifh.com|last = Thai|first = Flowerhorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Flowerhorn cichlids have a lifespan of 10–12 years. They are usually kept at a water temperature of 80&amp;ndash;85&amp;nbsp;°F, and a [[pH]] of 7.4&amp;ndash;8.0. They require a tank of a minimum of 55 gallons, with 125 gallons optimal. A breeding pair may require a tank of 150 gallons or more, depending on size. Being aggressive and territorial, two or more flowerhorns are usually not kept together, but the tank housing them can be divided up with acrylic dividers or egg crates.

There are several ways by which breeders distinguish between male and female flowerhorns. Generally, the males are larger than the females, but there are some exceptions. Males have the kok, or the nuchal hump, on their foreheads. Males also usually have brighter and more vivid colors. For most breeds, the females have black dots on their [[dorsal fin]]s, whereas males usually have longer anal and dorsal fins. Females tend to have an orange belly, especially when ready to breed. The mouth of the male is thicker and more pronounced than the female's. One sure way to determine the sex of flowerhorn is that grown female will lay eggs every month even without the male.&lt;ref name="thaifh.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = More flowerhorn guides on caring, breeding, determining sex|url = http://www.thaifh.com/flowerhorn-guides.html|website = Thai FH - Supplier of flowerhorn fish international|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flowerhorn cichlids are subject to several diseases, including [[head and lateral line erosion|hole-in-head disease]], [[Ichthyophthirius multifiliis|"ich"]], and digestive blockages.

== Breeds ==
[[File:Post-77-1231053436.gif|thumb|left|450px|General flowerhorn classification, containing several subsets of strains from different countries and breeders. The parent breed is called Luohan, from the Chinese word for the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[arhat]]. The four main breeds of flowerhorn are Zhen Zhu, Golden Monkey, Kamfa, and Goldenbase Faders.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;]]

=== King Kong Parrots and Red Ingots ===

The blood parrot was the earliest defined type of cichlid hybrid, whereas the ''King Kong'' parrot represents an early stage in the transition to flowerhorn breeding.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; The blood parrot is smaller, with a bigger head, more protruding eyes, and a V-shaped mouth. The ''King Kong'' parrot is longer, with a reddish orange color, and a [[dorsal fin]] shorter than the [[anal fin]]. The shape of the ''King Kong'' is similar to the red devil cichlid, and, when it reaches a size of 18&amp;nbsp;cm, the shape of the mouth changes to a triangle with a more protruding jaw. Only 20% of these fish grow to a size of a half kilogram.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

Blood parrots and ''King Kong'' parrots are sometimes colored purple or blue by [[painted fish|pigment injection]]. This practice is unhealthy for the fish, and the color will fade with time.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; Parrot cichlids fed with natural colorants and attractants naturally develop a red color. With further breeding, a round body shape has been selected, with the dorsal fin and anal fin longer than the tail fin, and the mouth can open and close naturally. These fish have clear eyes, and 90% of them grow to 1&amp;nbsp;kg or above, with the characteristic flowerhorn head shape.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

The ''Red Mommon'' and ''Red Ingot'' breeds are the most typical of these hybrid cichlids. Both of these fishes are appreciated for [[feng shui]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold W (2003) Singapore's 'lucky' pet Luohan can outnumber people in homes. International Herald Tribune. July 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Red Mommon'' is named for its high forehead, which looks like the hat worn by the God of Fortune. The ''Red Ingot'' is named for its ''yuan-bao'' shape, referring to odd-shaped gold or silver pieces formerly used as money in China.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

The ''Red Mommon'' and ''Red Ingot'' grow faster in the first year, with a size of about 20&amp;nbsp;cm. They grow to 25&amp;ndash;28&amp;nbsp;cm by two years later. Their maximum size is not yet known, and it is believed that the fish may grow to 30&amp;nbsp;cm or above in the future. Both of these fish are raised at 28&amp;nbsp;°C water temperature, pH ~6&amp;ndash;8 (with slightly acid water preferred), and [[carbonate hardness|kH]] ~3&amp;ndash;6, while avoiding any sudden change in water quality. It is also common to test regularly for [[ammonia]] and [[nitrite]]. Both of these fishes can be bred with different kinds of cichlids.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== Golden Monkey ===
[[File:Post-19-1231048027.jpg|thumb|right|274px|Golden Monkey]]
The genuine ''Golden Monkey'' (also called ''Good Fortune'') or ''Kamalau'' was bred by Mr. Lam Seah and Lam Soon in Bercham, Ipoh, Malaysia. After the third generation, all of them were sold to the A-1 Aquarium in 2001. This type of flowerhorn is an original ''Luohan''-based fish and not a mixed type ''Zen Zhu'' or ''Kamfa''.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

It can be a particularly expensive flowerhorn, carrying a price tag of more than one thousand dollars. The most expensive ''Golden Monkey'' was sold for $600,000 dollars during a Malaysian exhibition in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
{{Clear}}

=== Kamfa ===
[[File:Post-19-1231048629.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Kamfa]]
This breed originated from the ''Luohan''. Its main characteristics are white or yellow eyes (red eyes are possible but not common), a fan tail, a water-colored head bump, sunken eyes, and smaller lips than the ''Zhen Zhu''. This breed generally also has a larger and more square body than that of the ''Zhen Zhu''. Head flowers can be found on the ''Kamfa'', but not as prominently as with ''Zhen Zhus''.
{{Clear}}

=== Zhen Zhu ===
This breed originated slightly after the ''Kamfa'', derived from the ''Luohan''. It has a rounded tail, large mouth, red protruding eyes, and a prominent head flower. ''Zhen Zhu'' means "pearl flowerhorn." This breed's strongest characteristic is pearling. Breeders often cross other types with ''Zhen Zhus'' because they breed easily and can create better pearling (flowerline) for the next generation. Weak tails can also carry over, however.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== Golden Base (Faders) ===
[[File:Gallery 19 68 148247.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Golden Base]]
Faders are called by that name because during the juvenile period of life they lose their color and go completely black. As the fading process continues, the black "fades" away, leaving a more vibrant and beautiful color, usually yellow or red. They are also referred to as golden base or ''Golden Trimac''.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

'''[[cichlid#Hybrids and selective breeding|Red Texas cichlids]]''' are related to the golden base family of flowerhorns. They were originally created by breeding a [[Herichthys carpintis|green Texas cichlid]] with a ''Mammon'' or ''King Kong'' parrot, then crossing the offspring back to the parents until a consistent red color was achieved. Hobbyists consider the most important feature of the red Texas to be the color. Red Texas cichlids range in colors, and are rated as:

* Unfaded: lowest grade of red Texas.
* Yellow: second lowest grade.
* Orange: the majority of red Texas fall into this category.
* Coral: pinkish but not quite full red.
* Red: most desirable color.

The second characteristic that sets the red Texas apart is the pearling. Red Texas can vary greatly in terms of the type of pearling.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== King Kamfa ===
[[File:Kingkamfa.jpeg|thumb|237x237px|King Kamfa]]
From the ''Kamfa'' family, this fish typically has white or yellow sunken eyes, although red eyes are possible but rare. Distinctive features of this breed include an intense black double flower row along the [[lateral line]], and very thick white pearling. Originating in Thailand, this breed has seen a recent rebirth in Vietnam. The body is typical of a ''Kamfa'', with a fan tail, and a longer body than some other ''Kamfas''.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt; King Kamfa is the most expensive flowerhorn strain.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Kamfamalau ===
[[File:Post-19-1231048922.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kamfamalau]]
This is a cross of a ''Kamfa'' male and a ''Malau'' female. The body and face resemble a typical ''Kamfa'' (see above). The finnage and sunken eyes reflect the ''Kamfa'' genes. The main feature of a ''Kamfamalau'' is the pearling. Fins typically take on a "frosted" pearl look that is rarely found in any other breed of flowerhorn. Pearling usually crosses all the way across the head bump, another rarity in flowerhorn breeds. This breed should display the best characteristics of both ''Kamfa'' and ''Malau''.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== Thai Silk ===
The Thai Silk, also known as Titanium, is a relatively new breed. This flowerhorn breed is almost completely metallic blue, gold, or white. Its origins are unclear. A new strain of Thai silk has been developed that has a kamfa-type body and red, blue, or white eyes. It was believed to be a cross between White Tigers (Texas lineage), pure Texas cichlid and a Vieja.

== Strains ==
A strain is a more specific subset within a particular breed. Strains can get as narrowly defined as all coming from one individual parent fish. Strains can also differ by country of origin and by breeder.

=== JPG or Golden Apple ===
Created by Ah Soon of Malaysia, these fish are characterized by a large stocky body, as well as metallic pearling.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== IndoMalau ===
[[File:Post-137-1207905651.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Elvis strain]]
These were created by the Indonesian ''Luohan'' Club (ILC), using a ''Golden Monkey'' (or ''Malau'') female and a ''Zhen Zhu'' male. The second generation was spawned from the ''Elvis'' selection and a ''Golden Monkey'' female. The strain is characterized by extensive pearling all over the body, face, and head. What distinguishes an ''IndoMalau's'' pearls from that of a ''Zhen Zhu'' or a ''King Kamfa'' is that they are extremely fine. As the fish ages, the pearls become more intricately woven and thinner. Flowerlines vary dramatically; some only have a few flower spots. Most ILC ''IndoMalaus'' will include some singular flowers on the back line or "top row." The front half of the fish, from the [[pectoral fin]]s forwards, is red. The back half is a golden gradient intensifying in color towards the tail. The body is very wide and high, a throwback to the original ''Luohan''. There is a very pronounced chin or "gobbler." The head is usually forward-protruding.  The tail is fan-shaped, close to that of a ''Kamfa''. The dorsal and anal fins lack trailers, a common trait found also in ''Zhen Zhu''. The [[caudal peduncle]] is very large and pronounced in this strain &lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

[[File:Post-4-1216334880.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tan King strain]]

=== Tan King ===
This strain was created by Mr. Tan of Vietnam, by crossing a ''Zhen Zhu'' with a ''Kamfa''. It has pearls and a flowerline like a ''King Kamfa'', but the body and fins are more closely related to the ''Zhen Zhu''. Most have protruding eyes and a more rounded tail like a ''Zhen Zhu''.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

===Strains developed in the United States===
New flowerhorn strains have been developed through breeding programs in the U.S. Although it is hard for the U.S. to compete with Asia's well established flowerhorn breeding farms, strains with unique genetics have been created.

== Criticism ==
Criticism has also been made of placing flowerhorns, which are man-made fish, into fish taxa, which are reserved for the identification of species found in the wild.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} This practice can make identification of similar cichlids difficult. Breeding with pure bloodlines of cichlid species has already occurred in a number of cichlids commonly kept in the hobby, risking loss of genetic material.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Flowerhorn breeding&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thaifh.com/flowerhorn-guides.html&lt;/ref&gt; also contributes to the commercial demand for new and different fish, leading to unethical practices such as breeding for anatomical deformities, as occurred in goldfish breeding.

Flowerhorns have been criticized by cichlid hobbyists and [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] for a number of reasons. Interest in flowerhorns resulted in [[culling]] of surplus and deformed fish, some of which were dumped in the wild in Malaysia and Singapore, where they survived and disrupted riverine and pond [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/01027/environmental.html |title=The Flowerhorn Fish - Fish Facts - Environmental Impacts |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=31&amp;art_id=iol1045231471487W253&amp;set_id=1 |title=Killer fish unleashed in Malaysia - IOL SciTech |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/breeding/Soodhanan_Flowerhorns.html |title=Flowerhorns alias Nightmares, by Madhu Soodhanan |publisher=Aquarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other cichlids, flowerhorns are aggressive and can breed quickly, competing with and eating native fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecologyasia.com/news-archives/2003/nov-03/straitstimes_031102_1.htm Monster fish] Arlina Arshad, [[The Straits Times]], November 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hobbyists have questioned the impact of flowerhorn breeding programs and their impact on the natural species of the fish world. These hobbyists believe that all hybrid fish are detrimental to the aquarium hobby and will always be a topic of issue. These same hobbyists believe the creation of man-made hybrids makes it harder for other hobbyists to find and keep pure species.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The majority or even most flowerhorn males are sterile, which means that they cannot reproduce. By far, a very small percent of a batch would result in fertile males whereas the rest of the batch is sterile. Since not every male flowerhorn is fertile, finding a best or perfect fertile flowerhorn is time consuming. That is, hobbyists have to wait until the fish is sexually mature and then pair the male with a female to see if the male is fertile. It takes up to 8 months for a male flowerhorn to be sexually mature. A recommended age for a flowerhorn male to be tested its fertility is 10 months. Note: The process of testing the male's fertility is the same as pairing and breeding fertile ones.&lt;ref name="thaifh.com"/&gt;

'''Rare breed (dog)''' is any [[Dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] that is small in number and is used to refer to both old established breeds such as the [[Stabyhoun]] and [[Glen of Imaal Terrier]] or newer creations. Since dogs have greater genetic variability than other domesticated animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author= Christine Mlot
|date= June 28, 1997
|work= Science News Online
|quote = The influx of new genes from those crossings could very well explain the extraordinarily high number of dog breeds that exists today, the researchers suggest. Dogs have much greater genetic variability than other domesticated animals, such as cats
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of possible breeds is vast with new crosses constantly occurring, from these both selected and random crosses may come new breeds should offspring reliably breed true to type. New breeds from the wild such as the [[Carolina Dog]] are quite rare compared to attempts at breed creation from man as found in the [[American Hairless Terrier]] which sought to exploit a mutation.

== Establishment of breeds ==
Modern dog breeds have documented descent from known foundation stock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
|others= The Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff

|pages= 274
|quote= A breed is a group of domestic animals related through common ancestors and '''visiblily similar in most characteristics''', having been differentiated from others by human influence; a distinctive group of domesticated animals differentiated from the wild type under the influence of man, the sum of the progeny of a '''known and designated foundation stock''' without admixture of other blood.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new breeds are often derived from older, established modern breeds.{{Ref_label|1|note 1|none}} New documentation of a long established [[dog type]], sometimes with a variation on an older name, also creates a new modern breed.{{Ref_label|2|note 2|none}} The newly documented breed is then referred to as a ''rare breed'' as long as the number of dogs of the breed remain small.

== Recognition of rare breeds ==
Breeds go through a recognition process by breed clubs, kennel clubs and other agencies, so that dogs can be guaranteed through written documentation to be a [[Purebred (dog)|member of a specific breed]]. For example, the Canadian department of agriculture, [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]], has strict requirements for the registering of new breeds, which are referred to as "emerging breeds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/A-11.2//20080815/en?command=home&amp;caller=SI&amp;fragment=Animal%20Pedigree&amp;search_type=all&amp;day=15&amp;month=8&amp;year=2008&amp;search_domain=cs&amp;showall=L&amp;statuteyear=all&amp;lengthannual=50&amp;length=50 Animal Pedigree Act] "evolving breed" (race en voie de constitution) means a group of animals in the process of evolving into a new breed.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, this process was limited to each country's national governing body for dog breeds (two in the case of the United States), and gaining recognition for a new breed was a closely checked, long process. With the advent of the internet a vast number of minor registries has proliferated, allowing clubs, breeders, and internet entrepreneurs to create their own registries for their own purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the number of dogs being marketed as or referred to as registered members of a ''rare breed'' has increased.

Although such landraces may not be rare in their home environment, they are considered rare when brought to other parts of the world for pets or (rarely) to do the work for which they originally developed. An example is the [[Sage Koochee|Kuchi dog]], a [[livestock guardian dog]] type which originated with the nomadic [[Kuchi]] people of [[Central Asia]], and is now marketed in Europe and the United States as several differently named purebred rare breeds.

'''Domestic [[Goose|geese]]''' (''Anser anser domesticus'' or ''Anser cygnoides domesticus'') are domesticated [[grey geese]] (either [[greylag goose|greylag geese]] or [[Swan goose|swan geese]]) that are kept by [[human]]s as [[poultry]] for their meat, eggs, and [[down feathers]] since ancient times.

==Origins and characteristics==
[[File:Domestic geese swimming.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[swan goose]]-type domestic geese swimming]]

In [[Europe]], northern [[Africa]], and western [[Asia]], the original domesticated geese are derived from the [[greylag goose]] (''Anser anser''). In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the [[swan goose]] (''Anser cygnoides''); these are commonly known as '''Chinese geese'''. Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as [[Australia]] and [[North America]]) may consist of either species or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between them. Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob at the base of the bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between the two species.&lt;ref name=faob&gt;Buckland, R., &amp; Guy, G. (2002). ''Goose Production''. Chapter 1: [http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y4359E/y4359e03.htm Origins and Breeds of Domestic Geese]. FAO Agriculture Department.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[domestication]], as [[Charles Darwin]] remarks (''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' i. 287), is of very ancient date, with archaeological evidence for domesticated geese in [[Egypt]] more than 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;Hugo, S. (undated). [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V6200T/v6200T0n.htm Geese: the underestimated species]. FAO Agriculture Department.&lt;/ref&gt; They are much larger, and they have been selected for that larger size, with domesticated breeds weighing up to {{convert|10|kg}},&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; compared to the maximum of {{convert|3.5|kg}} for the wild swan goose and {{convert|4.1|kg}} for the wild greylag goose.&lt;ref name=hbw&gt;del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., &amp; Sargatal, J., eds. ''[[Handbook of Birds of the World]]'' Vol. 1: 581. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-87334-10-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects their body structure; whereas wild geese have a horizontal posture and slim rear end, domesticated geese lay down large fat deposits toward the tail end, giving a fat rear and forcing the bird into a more upright posture. Although their heavy weight affects their ability to fly, most breeds of domestic geese are capable of flight. 

Geese have also been strongly selected for [[fecundity]], with females laying up to 50 [[egg (biology)|eggs]] per year, compared to 5–12 eggs for a wild goose.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;

As most domestic geese display little [[sexual dimorphism]], sexing is based primarily on physical characteristics and behaviour. Males are typically taller and larger than females, and have longer necks. In addition, males can be distinguished by the protective behaviour they exhibit towards their mates and their offspring - the male will typically stand between his partner and any perceived threat. 

Changes to the plumage are variable; many have been selected to lose dark brown tones of the wild bird. The result is an animal marked, or completely covered in white feathers. Others retain plumage close to the natural; some, such as the modern [[Toulouse goose]] look almost identical to the greylag in plumage, differing only in structure. White geese are often preferred as they look better plucked and dressed, with any small down feathers remaining being less conspicuous. From the time of the Romans, white geese have been held in great esteem.

Geese produce large edible eggs, weighing {{convert|120|-|170|g}}.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; They can be used in cooking just like chicken's eggs, though they have proportionally more yolk, and this cooks to a slightly denser consistency. The taste is much the same as that of a chicken egg, but gamier.

Like their wild ancestors, domestic geese are very protective of their offspring and other members of the flock. The gander will normally place himself between any perceived threat and his family. Owing to their highly aggressive nature, loud call and sensitivity to unusual movements, geese can contribute towards the security of a property.&lt;ref name="Using Geese for Security"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/V6200T/v6200T0n.htm#the_unbridable_watchdog|title=Geese, the unbridable watchdog|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|date=16 August 2014 |accessdate=16  August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1950s South Vietnam, the [[VNAF]] used flocks of geese to guard their parked aircraft at night due to the noise they would make at intruders.&lt;ref&gt;Grandolini, A. ''Indo-Chinese Fighting ' Cats: Grumman's Superb Bearcat in Vietnam'' Air Enthusiast magazine article  July-August 1997 No.70 p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

Because domestic geese descended from the [[Greylag goose]] are effectively the same species as their wild ancestor (being a subspecies formed through domestication), escaped individuals readily breed with wild populations, resulting in the offspring sometimes resembling either one of their parents, or bearing mixed plumage with patterns of grey and white feathers.

==Geese in fiction and myth==
[[File:Goose attack.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic geese have been used for centuries as [[Guard goose|watch animals and guards]], and are among the most aggressive of all poultry.]]
[[File:MotteGeese.jpg|thumb|left|"The geese of the Capitol" by [[Henri-Paul Motte]], 1889]]
When Aphrodite first came ashore she was welcomed by the [[Charites]] (Roman "Graces"), whose chariot was drawn by geese.

There are [[Mother Goose]] tales, such as a farmwife might have told; there is the proverbial [[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs|goose that laid the golden eggs]], warning about the perils of greed.

The geese in the temple of Juno on the [[Capitoline Hill]] were said by [[Livy]] to have saved [[Rome]] from the [[Gaul]]s around 390 BC when they were disturbed in a night attack.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cocker |first1=Mark |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Mabey |title=Birds Britannica |titlelink=Birds Britannica |date=2005 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |isbn=0-7011-6907-9 |pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story may be an attempt to explain the origin of the sacred flock of geese at Rome.

Liliane Bodson and Daniel Marcolungo, ''L'oie de bon aloi: Aspects de l'histoire ancienne de l'oie domestique'' [The goose in ancient life and folklore]. Vise (Musée Regional d'Archeologie et d'Histoire de Vise), 1994, discusses the image and lore of domestic geese in classical antiquity, with a separate chapter on the goose in folklore.

[[Image:Rabbit in hutch.jpg|thumb|A rabbit in a tiny hutch]]

A '''hutch''' is a type of [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] used typically for housing [[domestic rabbit]]s.  Other small animals can also be housed in hutches.

Most hutches have a frame constructed of [[wood]], including legs to keep the unit off the ground. The floor may be wood, [[wire mesh]], or some combination of the two. Wire mesh is very bad for rabbits' feet and can cause sore hocks. One or more walls of the hutch are also wire mesh to allow for [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. Some hutches have built-in [[nest box]]es and shingled roofs—these are generally intended to be placed directly outside rather than inside another shelter such as a [[Barn (building)|barn]]. Some hutches have a felt roof. In any case it is important that the hutch is draft-free and provides a shelter in case the animal is scared and wants to retreat to a safe haven.

The generally accepted minimum hutch size is 10 square feet for a 4&amp;nbsp;kg medium sized breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sentry|first1=Rebbeca|title=BestRabbitHutch.com|url=http://www.bestrabbithutch.com/|website=BestRabbitHutch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the animal is very protective or even aggressive, this is generally a sign that the hutch is too small. However, it has in the past decade, become unacceptable for people who are more knowledgeable about rabbits' needs that they should live in a hutch of this size, or any small cage for that matter. Rabbits love to run and jump and need space. For many animal rescues, now a predator safe run must be attached to, or contain the hutch; the run must be at least  10 ft x 6 ft with a run height of 3ft, or in metric, 3m x 2m and a run height of 1m. (Rabbit Welfare Association and Trust, 2018) Even more space to live in is better.

This is a '''list of domesticated animal breeds originating from Scotland'''. To be considered [[domesticated]], a population of animals must have their [[Ethology|behaviour]], [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], or [[physiology]] systemically altered as a result of being under human control for many generations.&lt;ref name=zeder2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zeder MA|year=2015|title=Core questions in domestication Research|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=112|issue=11|pages=3191–8|doi=10.1073/pnas.1501711112|pmid=25713127|pmc=4371924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scotland]] has produced some of the longest established breeds of domesticated animals still in existence. There are 37 individual breeds of animals from Scotland still in existence and three extinct breeds. The [[Soay Sheep]] has [[prehistory|prehistoric]] origins, and the [[Galloway cattle|Galloway]] breed of [[beef cattle]] dates back several hundred years. New breeds have also been developed more recently in Scotland, such as the [[Scottish Fold]] cat, which dates from 1961.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.petfinder.com/cat-breeds/Scottish-Fold|title = Scottish Fold Cat Information|date = |accessdate = 14 November 2015|website = Pet Finder|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Ronaldsay sheep|North Ronaldsay Sheep]] is a most unusual breed, subsisting largely on a diet of [[seaweed]],&lt;ref name=SheepCentre&gt;

Various breeds are now extinct, including the [[Grice]], an archaic and somewhat aggressive pig.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate = 1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal mummification''' originated in [[ancient Egypt]]. They mummified various animals. It was an enormous part of Egyptian culture, not only in their role as food and pets, but also for religious reasons. They were typically mummified for four main purposes—to allow beloved pets to go on to the afterlife, to provide food in the [[afterlife]], to act as offerings to a particular [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]], and because some were seen as physical manifestations of specific gods that the Egyptians worshipped. Bast, the cat goddess is an example of one such deity.&lt;ref&gt;Jackowski, Christian. "Common and Unexpected Findings in Mummies from Ancient Egypt and South America revealed by CT." CMIV Seminar. Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization, [[Linköping]], Sweden. 17 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1888, an Egyptian farmer digging in the sand near [[Istabl Antar]] discovered a mass grave of felines, ancient cats that were mummified and buried in pits at great numbers.

== Egyptian beliefs about animals == 
Throughout the history of [[ancient Egypt]], animals were highly respected. In no other culture have animals been as influential in so many aspects of life, nor has any culture depicted animals as often in their artwork or writing.&lt;ref name=Velde&gt;Velde, H. "A Few Remarks upon the Religious Significance of Animals in Ancient Egypt." Numen 27 (1980): 76-82.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 2 in every 4 or 5 Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s relates to animals.&lt;ref name="Velde" /&gt; Egyptians believed that animals were crucial to both physical and spiritual survival—vital to physical survival because they were a major source of food and to spiritual survival based on how well a person treated animals during their life on earth.&lt;ref name="Velde" /&gt; Some animals were considered to be literal incarnations of the gods, and therefore, it is understandable why Egyptians would have wanted to hold such animals in the highest regard, giving them a proper burial through mummification.&lt;ref name=Leca&gt;Leca, Ange P. The Egyptian Way of Death. Doubleday, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian religion taught of life after death. In order to determine a person’s admittance or denial to the afterlife, the gods would ask a series of judgment questions.&lt;ref name="Velde" /&gt; One of these crucial questions would be whether they had mistreated any animals during their life on earth.&lt;ref name="Velde" /&gt; Because of this religious belief, the killing of an animal was considered a serious crime punishable by death.&lt;ref name=Aufderheide&gt;Aufderheide, Arthur C. The Scientific Study of Mummies. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]], a Greek historian from the 1st century B.C., witnessed the lynching of a Roman who had accidentally killed a cat during a visit to Egypt. Understandably, this punishment frightened many Egyptians to the point that if one would happen upon a dead animal, they would flee from it as to avoid the accusation of being its killer.&lt;ref name=Pettigrew&gt;Pettigrew, Thomas J., and George Cruikshank. A History of Egyptian Mummies. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beloved pets=== 
Long before animal mummies were used as religious offerings, animals in Egypt were occasionally mummified for a more personal reason—as beloved pets that were to keep the deceased company in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=Lawrence&gt;Lawrence, Susan V. "Unraveling the Mysteries of the Mummies." Science News, Society for Science and the Public 118 (1980): 362-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common Egyptian pets included cats, dogs, mongooses, monkeys, gazelles, and birds. Many Egyptians loved their pets, and the customary process of mourning the loss of a loved pet included crying and shaving one’s eyebrows. Ancient Egyptian pets were given names like we name our pets today, evidenced by over 70 names deciphered inscriptions identifying pet dog mummies.&lt;ref name=Arnold&gt;Arnold, Dorothea. "An Egyptian Bestiary." The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin new 52 (1995): 1-64.&lt;/ref&gt;
Pets were often depicted on the tombs of Egyptians, indicating their masters’ affection toward the animals.&lt;ref name=Dunand&gt;[[Dunand, Francoise]], Roger Lichtenberg, and Jean Yoyotte. Mummies and Death in Egypt. New York: Cornell University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians believed that mummification was imperative in order to gain admittance to the afterlife, and therefore the belief was that the mummification of these pets would ensure the animals’ immortality.&lt;ref name="Dunand" /&gt;
Specific archaeological findings have confirmed that pets were mummified. The most famous example of this is the [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] Queen [[Makare]]’s adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops).  When her tomb was discovered, there was a small, mummified bundle present at her feet, which was initially believed to be her child. This puzzled archaeologists because Queen Makare was a High Priestess who had taken a serious vow of celibacy.&lt;ref name=Brier&gt;Brier, Bob. Egyptian Mummies: Unraveling the Secrets of an Ancient Art. New York: HarperCollins, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; If this had been her child, it would have meant that she had, at some point, broken the oath she had taken as High Priestess, raising a slew of other questions regarding her life.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; Finally, in 1968, an x-ray was done on the small mummy, and it was determined to be an adult Green Monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), not a child.&lt;ref name="Leca"/&gt; Similarly, Makare’s half sister, [[Esemkhet]], was discovered buried with a mummified pet—she had a mummified gazelle in her tomb.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; Prince [[Crown Prince Thutmose|Tuthmosis]] of the Dynasty XVIII was also buried with a beloved animal—his pet cat was mummified and placed in a stone coffin in his tomb.&lt;ref name="Dunand" /&gt; Another Egyptian, named Hapymen, had his pet dog mummified, wrapped in cloth, and placed at the side of his coffin.&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;"Animal Mummies." The Animal Mummy Project. 2000. The Cairo Museum. 10 December 2008 &lt;http://www.animalmummies.com/project.html&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107021735/http://www.animalmummies.com/project.html |date=January 7, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the tomb KV 50 in the Valley of Kings, a mummified dog and baboon were discovered buried together, though the owner is unknown.&lt;ref name="Cairo" /&gt;

===Food for the afterlife===
Egyptians believed that the afterlife would be a continuation of this one, allowing for the transportation of items from this life to the next.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; In order to bring food to the afterlife, Egyptians would surround human mummies by what are known as victual mummies.&lt;ref name="Cairo" /&gt; These animals were prepared by dehydrating the meat and wrapping it in linen bandages, to indicate that the animals were food, not pets.&lt;ref name="Cairo" /&gt; They were not mummified to the same meticulous extent that a pet or human mummy would be, but the animals were nonetheless carefully preserved using natron and other special salts.&lt;ref name="Cairo" /&gt; This food was included in tombs in order to sustain the deceased person’s soul, called the ka, during the journey to the next world.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; A variety of food has been found in many tombs, mostly breads, meats, and fowl.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; King Tutankhamen’s tomb held several coffin shaped wooden boxes containing this type of mummified animal, in his case duck and other types of meat.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt;

===Religious purposes===
[[File:John Reinhard Weguelin – The Obsequies of an Egyptian Cat (1886).jpg|thumb|''The Obsequies of an Egyptian Cat'', by [[John Reinhard Weguelin]] (1886).]]
[[Ancient Egyptian religion]] was characterized by polytheism, the belief in multiple gods.&lt;ref name="Leca" /&gt; Prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, there were a tremendous number of these gods, each representative of a different element of the natural world.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide"/&gt; After the great unification, a more limited list of gods developed.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide" /&gt; These gods were usually depicted as having a human body and an animal head, further emphasizing the importance of animals in Egyptian religion.&lt;ref name="Aufderheide" /&gt; Over time, religious cults emerged for the worship of each specific god. Two main types of worship distinguished the cults—the first choosing to worship the god through mass mummified animal offerings and the second selecting a totem animal to represent the god,&lt;ref name="Aufderheide" /&gt; which was mummified at the time of its death.

==== Votive offerings====
The vast majority of Egyptian animal mummies were religious offerings.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; If an Egyptian sought a favor from a god, he would purchase or make an offering and place it at the appropriate temple of the god he wished to please.&lt;ref name="Velde"/&gt; Before animal mummification became common, these offerings were usually bronze statues depicting the animals.&lt;ref name="Brier" /&gt; However, eventually a cheaper alternative to bronze statues—animal mummies—became the most popular form of offering. Literally millions of these mummified animals have been discovered throughout Egypt. Inspection of these mummies, usually done through CT scans which allow researchers to examine the skeletons of the mummies without damaging the outer wrappings, has suggested that these types of animals were bred for the sole purpose of offerings. As the process of animal mummification for the purpose of offerings grew, mummification techniques became progressively less meticulous. Studies have revealed many of the large-scale animal offerings to be ‘fakes’ — the wrappings containing only a few bones, feathers, reeds, wood, or pieces of pottery. The animals were raised on temple grounds, and then sold to pilgrims or regular citizens. The animals’ necks were often broken, an indication that their sole purpose in life was to be sacrificed as offerings. When visiting the temples, Egyptians of the general public would purchase these pre-mummified animals and offer them to the gods.

The Egyptian god Hor, living in the second century BCE suggests the purpose underlying the practice of mummifying animals: "The benefit [of mummification] which is performed for the Ibis, the soul of Toth, the greatest one, is made for the Hawk also, the soul of Ptah, the soul of Apis, the soul of Pre, the soul of Shu, the soul of Tefnut, the soul of Geb, the soul of Osiris, the soul of Isis, the soul of Nephtys, the great gods of Egypt, the Ibis and the Hawk." Hor believes that the mummies are the souls of the gods: he describes the ibis as the soul of Toth and the hawk as the soul of many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ''ba''- a part of the soul that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are the animals' souls acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiberg, Edward, '' Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum: 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cats =====
{{see also|Cats in ancient Egypt#Funerary traditions}}
[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]
Cats were mummified as religious offerings in enormous quantities and were believed to represent the war goddess [[Bastet]]. This cult was primarily centered at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Beni Hasan]] beginning in the [[Ptolemaic Period]]. At Beni Hasan, there were so many cat mummies that at the end of the 19th century, a total of 19 tons of mummified Egyptian cats were shipped to England to be used as fertilizer. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of [[Saqqara]]. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of packing material. They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went by, like all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir [[T. C. S. Morrison-Scott]], former Director of the [[British Museum of Natural History]], unwrapped a large number of cat mummies, but discovered many were simply stuffed with random body parts of cats and not mummified with detailed care.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===== Ibises =====
[[File:Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48.jpg|thumb|Ibis Coffin, 305-30 B.C.E., 49.48, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The [[ibis]] cult was established primarily during the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] periods and was dedicated to the god of wisdom, [[Thoth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/2014/09/25/animal-mummification/|title=Animal Mummification|date=2014-09-25|work=Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research from 2015 using 14C radiocarbon dating suggests that the Egyptian Ibis mummies in the study were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC. This timing falls in Egyptian history between the Late Period to the Ptolemaic Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasef|first=S.|last2=Wood|first2=R.|last3=Merghani|first3=S. El|last4=Ikram|first4=S.|last5=Curtis|first5=C.|last6=Holland|first6=B.|last7=Willerslev|first7=E.|last8=Millar|first8=C.D.|last9=Lambert|first9=D.M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of Sacred Ibis mummies from ancient Egypt|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352409X15301243|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume=4|pages=355–361|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.09.020|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of mummified ibises is extraordinary. Saqqara alone is estimated to contain nearly 500,000 of these mummies and is also thought to have produced 10,000 mummified offerings per year. In addition, approximately four million ibis burials have been uncovered at the catacombs of [[Tune el-Gebel]]. Mummification of the ibis included desiccation and evisceration. Usually, the head and neck of the bird were bent backwards and pressed on the body. The body was then dipped in tar and wrapped tightly with linen. The vast number of mummified ibises suggests that this was done in a mass production, as many times the mummies contained only a part of the body. After serving their ritual purposes, the mummified bodies were placed in ceramic pots, coffins or sarcophagi.

===== Baboons =====
[[File:Egyptian - Baboon Mummy Coffin - Walters 22245.jpg|thumb|This coffin, shaped like a baboon, once contained the remains of a baboon as an offering to the god [[Thoth]]. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
Baboons also represented [[Thoth]], the god of the moon as well as the god of wisdom. The appearance of baboons on [[canopic jar]]s, which housed the organs of human mummies, is testament of the animals’ tremendous cultural significance. Baboons were reared in mass quantities at temples, though the numbers of baboon mummies that have been discovered are not as large as cats or ibises. Around 400 were uncovered at the tombs of Saqqara. Most baboons were mummified with the use of plaster and buried in wooden chests. Baboon mummies that have been discovered have provided significant evidence that they were bred and mummified as offerings. This evidence includes proof that the baboons usually did not die from natural causes, and that the majority suffered from malnutrition, fractures, [[osteomylitis]], and vitamin D deficiency.

===== Crocodiles =====
The crocodile was regarded as an extremely fierce animal, often used to terrify enemies during war. The crocodile cult was devoted to [[Sebek]], god of fertility, and the sun god, Re. Typically, crocodiles were raised in a life of complete luxury, indulged until they died. In the early years of this cult, dead crocodiles were lavishly mummified with gold and other precious things. However, as mummification gradually became a production process, less effort was exerted in their mummification and eventually consisted simply of cloth wrappings and the application of resin, a preserving agent. When found in extremely large quantities, crocodile mummies, like many other sorts of animal offerings, contained only reeds or random body parts.
At the main temple of Shedet, later called Crocodilopolis, sacred crocodiles were mummified and displayed in temple shrines or carried in processions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg, Edward]], '' Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum: 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Fish =====
Fish were mummified in mass quantities as offerings to the god. They were wrapped in linen and held together by bands of cloth soaked in sticky resin, permanently encasing the mummies. Many times, black circles representing the eyes were painted on the hardened linen. Several species of fish have been identified, but due to the deteriorating condition of the mummies, scientists are unable to conclude if the organs were typically removed during the process of mummification. According to the Museum of Liverpool the Nile perch was one of the species mummified and offered to the gods on of these cults is related to The goddess [[Neith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/collections/antiquities/ancient-egypt/item-391503.aspx|title=Fish Mummy, Ancient Egypt collection|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Miscellaneous animals =====
[[File:Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308.jpg|thumbnail|Dog Mummy, 305 B.C.E.-395 C.E.,05.308, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Additional animals mummified and the corresponding god they represented:&lt;ref name="Cairo" /&gt;
*Mongoose/Shrew ([[Horus]])
**A large type of mongoose common in Africa, the ichneumon (''Herpestes ichneumon'') is represented in Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Revered for its ability to kill snakes, the ichneumon was related to Horus and Atum, among others and worshipped throughout the country. The shrew, a mouse size nocturnal mammal, substituted for ichneumons in Egyptian myth. Believed to have vision in both light and darkness, the god Horus Khenty-irty of Letopolis was represented by the wide eyed type of ichneumon and the shrew respectively. Shrews appear as the focus of worship particularly in the Late Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dogs/Jackals ([[Anubis]])
**Dogs were used as domestic pets, guardians, herders, and police assistants. Several dog breeds could be found in ancient Egypt, the most popular being the greyhound, basenji, and saluki, all very good for hunting. From the First Dynasty, Egyptians venerated several jackal deities, with the most prominent one was of Anubis. He was represented as a canine or a canine headed human. Traditionally, the Anubis animal has been identified as a jackal, but its generally black coloring, symbolic of the afterlife and rebirth, is not typical of jackals and may instead denote a wild dog. Because dogs and jackals roamed the desert's edge, where the dead were generally buried, they were seen as protectors of cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Birds of all types (Horus) (Birds were held in containers shaped like food because they would be used as food in the after life.)
*Serpent/Eel ([[Atum]])
**Among serpents and eels, snakes and lizards were also popular depictions of the god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, involved in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians were well aware of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin and the dangers posed by its poison. Texts like the [[Brooklyn Papyrus]] include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Beetles (Cherpera){{Citation needed|reason=There are few Google results for this "Cherpera" deity.|date=July 2018}}
**Among beetles, the scarab was very popular in Egyptian culture. Images of scarabs were placed in tombs as early as the fourth millennium BCE and used as official seals and amulets for the living and the dead. The Egyptian word for scarab also means "to come into being" or "appear". A scarab pushing a spherical object evoked the image of a beetle propelling the sun disk through heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]]|first1=Edward|title=Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt|date=2013|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sacred animals ====
Instead of worshipping every animal of a particular species, a few animal cults would select one specific animal, chosen because of its special markings, to be the totem of the particular god. Each sacred animal was pampered and cared for until its death, when elaborate burial proceedings took place. The animal was then mummified as a sign of respect to the god. Next, a new symbolic animal was chosen. Only one animal at a time would be chosen as the sacred one. These animal cults reached the pinnacle of popularity during the Late and [[Graeco-Roman]] Periods. The cycle of selecting a new totem animal continued for hundreds of years. Though the animals were undoubtedly considered sacred, Egyptians did not worship the individual animals themselves, but rather the invisible deity believed to be present within the animal symbolizing the deity. In certain cases, such as the Apis bull, the animal could even be a way to communicate the desires of the god. The Apis [[bull cult]] was the main source of this type of religious animal mummy in ancient Egypt, as most other animals were mummified in large quantities for religious offerings.

===== Bulls =====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The [[Apis (god)|Apis]] bull cult is estimated to have originated as early as 800 B.C., the first cult supported by archaeological evidence. The earliest and largest of all animal cults, the Apis bull cult considered the bull to be a symbol of strength and fertility, representing the creator gods Ptah and Osiris. Mummification was a key part in the worshipping of these animals. While alive, the bull would be housed in a special temple, lavishly pampered for its entire life. Priests believed that the Apis bull was a medium of communication between the two creator gods, so its movements were carefully observed and sometimes consulted as an oracle. These sacred animals were allowed to die a natural death unless they reached the age of 28, at which time they were killed. When an Apis bull died, the entire country went into mourning. It was afforded an elaborate funeral and intricate burial procedures. Because the bulls were so large, the process of mummification was lengthy and complicated. Enormous alabaster embalming tables were constructed at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the center of the cult. They were complete with engravings and fluid drainage channels. After the funerary ceremonies, the bull would be transported to these tables where it would be strapped to the table. Its internal organs would be destroyed through intra-anal oils. The animal’s body would be dried out using [[natron]] salts and packed with sand. It would then be wrapped in linens. Artificial eyes and an artistic plaster head would be added, ensuring the bull still looked like itself.

== Differences between human and non-human animal mummification ==
The distinguishing factor between the process of non-human animal and human mummification is when the two types were mummified. Humans had been mummified consistently since the days of the early conquerors of [[Lower Egypt]], hundreds of years before even the first non-human animal was mummified. The earliest signs of non-human animal mummies are dated to the [[Badarian]] [[Predynastic Period]] (5500–4000BC) after the unification of upper and lower Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is likely that animal mummies did not exist earlier on because mummification was less accessible primarily due to cost. 
In general, the mummifying of animals was not given the careful attention afforded to humans. Mummies sold to pilgrims as offerings were only minimally treated, and unlike humans, even the most sacred of animals, such as the Apis bulls, did not have their internal organs preserved. The large scale of production indicates that relatively little care and expense was involved in animal preparation compared to human mummies. However, recent radiological studies by archeologists indicate that animal mummification may more closely follow human mummification than was originally thought. The accepted view is that animals were merely wrapped in coarse linen bandages and/or dipped in resin after death. However, as with human mummification there was a range in terms of the quality of treatments. A simple visual analysis of the mummies suggests that some animal mummies were treated with the same complexity as those of humans. Egyptians treated animals with great respect, regarding them both as domestic pets and representatives of the gods. The presence of fats, oils, beeswax, sugar gum, petroleum bitumen, and coniferous cedar resins in animal mummies shows that the chemicals used to embalm animals were similar to those used on humans.

The  '''guinea pig''' or '''domestic guinea pig''' (''Cavia porcellus''), also known as '''cavy''' or '''domestic cavy''', is a species of [[rodent]] belonging to the family [[Caviidae]] and the genus ''[[Cavia]]''. Despite their [[common name]], these animals are not in the pig family [[Suidae]], nor do they come from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]] in Africa, and the origin of their name is still unclear; they originated in the [[Andes]] of South America and studies based on [[biochemistry]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] suggest they are [[domestication|domesticated]] descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as ''[[Montane Guinea Pig|C. tschudii]]'', and therefore do not exist naturally in the wild.&lt;ref name=weir/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book|last = Nowak|first = Ronald M.|title = Walker's Mammals of the World, 6th edition|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0-8018-5789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- As pets --&gt;
In [[Western society]], the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a [[Pet|household pet]], a type of [[pocket pet]], since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate, responsiveness to handling and feeding; and the relative ease of caring for them have made and continue to make guinea pigs a popular choice of pet. Organizations devoted to the [[Animal fancy|competitive breeding]] of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many [[Guinea pig breed|specialized breeds]] with varying [[Coat (animal)|coat]] colors and textures are selected by [[Breeder (animal)|breeders]].

&lt;!-- In South America --&gt;
The domestic guinea pig plays an important role in [[folk culture]] for many [[Indigenous peoples of the Andes|indigenous Andean groups]], especially as a food source, but also in [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] and in community religious ceremonies.{{sfn|Morales|1995}} The animals are used for meat and are a culinary staple in the [[Andes Mountains]], where they are known as '''''cuy'''''. A modern breeding program was started in the 1960s in Peru that resulted in large breeds known as ''cuy mejorados'' and prompted efforts to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news|last = Vecchio|first = Rick|title = Peru Pushes Guinea Pigs as Food|publisher = [[CBS News]]|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/world/main650148.shtml|date = 2004-10-19|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- As test subjects --&gt;
[[Animal testing|Biological experimentation]] on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were so frequently used as [[model organism]]s in the 19th and 20th centuries that the [[epithet]] ''guinea pig'' came into use to describe a [[human subject research|human test subject]]. Since that time, they have been largely replaced by other rodents such as [[House Mouse|mice]] and [[Brown Rat|rats]]. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus type 1|juvenile diabetes]], [[tuberculosis]], [[scurvy]] (like humans, they must get [[vitamin C]]), and [[pre-eclampsia|pregnancy complications]].

==Name==
The scientific name of the common species is ''Cavia porcellus'', with ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:porcellus|porcellus]]}}'' being [[Latin]] for "[[diminutive|little]] pig". ''Cavia'' is [[New Latin]]; it is derived from ''cabiai'', the animal's name in the language of the [[Galibi]] tribes once native to [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cavy|publisher = Oxford English Dictionary online (subscription access required)|url = http://dictionary.oed.com|accessdate = 2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cabiai'' may be an adaptation of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''çavia'' (now ''savia''), which is itself derived from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word ''saujá'', meaning rat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Definition of cavy|publisher = Merriam-Webster Online|url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=cavy|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea pigs are called ''quwi'' or ''jaca'' in [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and ''cuy'' or ''cuyo'' (plural ''cuyes, cuyos'') in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.&lt;ref name="diccionario"&gt;{{cite web| title = Diccionario de la Lengua Española|publisher = Real Academia Española|url = http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/|language = Spanish|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, [[Animal fancy|breeders]] tend to use the more formal "cavy" to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts, it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial "guinea pig".{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=2}}

How the animals came to be called "pigs" is not clear. They are built somewhat like [[pig]]s, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=2}}{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=2}} They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=2}}

The animal's name alludes to pigs in many European languages. The [[German language|German]] word for them is ''[[wikt:Meerschweinchen|Meerschweinchen]]'', literally "little sea pig", which has been translated into [[Polish language|Polish]] as ''świnka morska'', into [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''tengerimalac'', and into [[Russian language|Russian]] as ''морская свинка''. This derives from the [[Middle High German]] name ''merswin''. This originally meant "[[dolphin]]" and was used because of the animals' grunting sounds (which were thought to be similar).&lt;ref&gt;Duden – Deutsches Universalwörterbuch. 4. Aufl. Mannheim 2001. [CD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt; Many other, possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist. For example, sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the [[New World]] would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat. The [[French language|French]] term is ''[[wikt:fr:cavia|cochon d'Inde]]'' (Indian pig) or ''cobaye''; the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] call it ''[[wikt:nl:cavia|Guinees biggetje]]'' (Guinean piglet) or cavia (while in some Dutch dialects it is called ''Spaanse rat''); and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the guinea pig is variously referred to as ''[[wikt:pt:cobaia|cobaia]]'', from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as ''porquinho da Índia'' (little Indian pig). This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is ''[[wikt:es:conejillo de Indias|conejillo de Indias]]'' (little rabbit of the Indies).&lt;ref name=diccionario/&gt; The Chinese refer to them as 豚鼠 (''túnshǔ'', 'pig mouse'), and sometimes as Netherlands pig (荷蘭豬, ''hélánzhū'') or Indian mouse (天竺鼠, ''tiānzhúshǔ''). The Japanese word for guinea pig is "モルモット" (''morumotto''), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the [[marmot]]; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843. The other Japanese word for guinea pig, using kanji, is ''tenjiku-nezumi'' (天竺鼠, or てんじくねずみ), which literally translates as ''India rat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://animals.japanesewithanime.com/animals/tenjikunezumi|title=tenjiku-nezumi - Meaning in Japanese {{!}} 天竺鼠 - Names of Animals in Japanese|website=animals.japanesewithanime.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of "guinea" in "guinea pig" is harder to explain. One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], leading people to think they had originated there.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=2}} "Guinea" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite web|title = Results for "Guinea pig"|publisher = Dictionary.com|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Guinea%20pig|accessdate = 2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cavy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis suggests the "guinea" in the name is a corruption of "[[The Guianas|Guiana]]", an area in [[South America]].&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt;{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|pp=2–3}} A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea coin]]; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and [[William Harvey]] used the term "Ginny-pig" as early as 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Harvey|first = William|title = Anatomical exercitations concerning the generation of living creatures to which are added particular discourses of births and of conceptions, &amp;c|year = 1653|page = 527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe "guinea" may be an alteration of the word [[wikt:coney|coney]] (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as "pig coneys" in [[Edward Topsell]]'s 1607 treatise on [[quadrupedalism|quadrupeds]].{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=2}}

==History==
The guinea pig was first [[domestication|domesticated]] as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the [[Andes|Andean]] region of [[South America]] (the present-day southern part of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]]),{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=3}} some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American [[camelid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Chazan|last = Chazan|first = Michael|title = World Prehistory and Archaeology: Pathways through Time|year = 2008|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn = 0-205-40621-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statues dating from ''circa'' 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador.{{sfn|Morales|1995|pages=3–4}} The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru: Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1200 AD to the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]] in 1532, selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book|last = Nowak|first = Ronald M.|title = Walker's Mammals of the World|edition = 6th|year = 1999|pages = 1667–1669|isbn = 0-8018-5789-9|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|location = Baltimore, Md.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continue to be a food source in the region; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal, which subsists on the family's vegetable scraps.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=8}} Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors.{{sfn|Morales|1995|pages=10–16, 45–74}}  They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or ''[[curandero]]s'', who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as [[jaundice]], [[rheumatism]], [[arthritis]], and [[typhus]].{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=96}} They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick, and are seen as a supernatural medium.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=78}} Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=87–88}} The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=83}} These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=75–78}}

[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|English]] traders brought guinea pigs to [[Europe]], where they quickly became popular as [[exotic pet]]s among the upper classes and royalty, including [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=3}} The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from [[Santo Domingo]]; because cavies are not native to [[Hispaniola]], the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers.&lt;ref name=weir&gt;{{Cite book|last = Weir|first = Barbara J.|contribution = Notes on the Origin of the Domestic Guinea-Pig|editor-last = Rowlands|editor-first = I.

Guinea pigs are large for rodents; the common pet breeds weigh between {{convert|700|and|1200|g|lb|abbr=on}} when full grown and measure between {{convert|20|and|25|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length.{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|p=13}} Some livestock breeds weigh {{Convert|3|kg|}} when full grown.&lt;ref name="yamamoto" /&gt; Pet breeds live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=132–133}} According to the 2006 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', the longest living guinea pig survived 14&amp;nbsp;years, 10.5&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Guinness Book of World Records]] |publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd. |year=2006 |isbn=1-904994-02-4 |editor-last=Glenday |editor-first=Craig |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most guinea pigs have fur, but one [[laboratory]] breed adopted by some pet owners, the [[skinny pig]], is a mostly furless breed. Some breeds are longfur breeds such as the [[Peruvian guinea pig|Peruvian]], the [[Silkie guinea pig|Silkie]], and the [[Texel Guinea Pig|Texel]].

In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that [[caviomorpha|caviomorphs]], such as guinea pigs, [[chinchilla]]s, and [[Octodon|degu]]s, are not rodents and should be [[Taxonomy (biology)|reclassified]] as a separate [[order (biology)|order]] of mammals (similar to [[lagomorpha|lagomorphs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Graur|first = D.|title = Is the Guinea-Pig a Rodent?|year = 1991|journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume = 351|pages = 649–652|doi = 10.1038/351649a0|last2 = Hide|first2 = Winston A.|last3 = Li|first3 = Wen-Hsiung|pmid = 2052090|issue = 6328|displayauthors = 1|bibcode = 1991Natur.351..649G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = D'Erchia|first = A.|title = The Guinea Pig is Not a Rodent|year = 1996|journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume = 381|pages = 597–600|doi = 10.1038/381597a0|last2 = Gissi|first2 = Carmela|last3 = Pesole|first3 = Graziano|last4 = Saccone|first4 = Cecilia|last5 = Arnason|first5 = Ulfur|pmid = 8637593|issue = 6583|displayauthors = 1|bibcode = 1996Natur.381..597D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research using wider sampling restored the consensus among mammalian biologists regarding the current classification of rodents as [[monophyly|monophyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Carleton|first = Michael D.|last2 = Musser|first2 = Guy G.|contribution = Order Rodentia|editor1-last = Wilson|editor1-first = Don E.|title = Mammal Species of the World|edition = 3rd|year = 2005|volume = 2|page = 745|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn = 0-8018-8221-4|editor2-last = Reeder|editor2-first = DeeAnn M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huchon |first=Dorothée |last2=Chevret |first2=Pascale |last3=Jordan |first3=Ursula |last4=Kilpatrick |first4=C.

===Behavior===
Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Charters|first = Jessie Blount Allen|title = The associative processes of the guinea pig: A study of the psychical development of an animal with a nervous system well medullated at birth|journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology|volume = XIV|issue = 4|pages = 300–337|publisher = University of Chicago|date=July 1904|url = https://books.google.com/?id=dWcKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA300&amp;lpg=RA2-PA300&amp;dq=guinea+pigs#PRA1-PA299,M2|accessdate = 2006-12-27|doi=10.1002/cne.920140402}}&lt;/ref&gt; While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, most of them are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile. They startle extremely easily, and either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=6}} Larger groups of startled guinea pigs "stampede", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=34}} When happily excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as "popcorning"), a movement analogous to the ferret's [[weasel war dance|war dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Guinea Pigs|publisher = Canadian Federation of Humane Societies|url = http://cfhs.ca/athome/guinea_pigs|accessdate = 2007-03-21|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402223933/http://cfhs.ca/athome/guinea_pigs/|archivedate = 2007-04-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also good swimmers.&lt;ref name=harkness&gt;{{cite book|last = Harkness|first = John E.|last2 = Wagner|first2 = Joseph E.|title = The Biology and Medicine of Rabbits and Rodents|publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 1995|pages = 30–39|isbn = 0-683-03919-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) at Keswick Public Library.jpg|thumb|Guinea pigs "social groom" each other|alt=|left]]

Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in [[social grooming]], and they regularly self-groom.{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|p=79}} A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=72}} Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture.&lt;ref name=harkness/&gt; Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), [[Goose bumps|piloerection]], aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=38}} Non-sexual simulated [[wikt:mount#Verb|mounting]] for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.

Guinea pig eyesight is not as good as that of a human in terms of distance and color, but they have a wider angle of vision (about 340°) and see in partial color ([[dichromacy]]). They have well-developed senses of hearing, [[olfaction|smell]], and touch.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|p=14}} 

Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=7}} These are the most common sounds made by the guinea pig:{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|pp=7–8}}
*A "'''wheek'''" is a loud noise, the name of which is [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]], also known as a whistle. An expression of general excitement, it may occur in response to the presence of its owner or to feeding. It is sometimes used to find other guinea pigs if they are running. If a guinea pig is lost, it may wheek for assistance. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Feeding Wheek.ogg|listen}}
*A bubbling or '''purring''' sound is made when the guinea pig is enjoying itself, such as when being petted or held. It may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Happy.ogg|listen}}
*A '''rumbling''' sound is normally related to dominance within a group, though it can also come as a response to being scared or angry. In the case of being scared, the rumble often sounds higher and the body vibrates shortly. While courting, a male usually purrs deeply, swaying and circling the female{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=39}} in a behavior called "'''rumblestrutting'''". A low rumble while walking away reluctantly shows [[Passive aggressive|passive]] resistance. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Keep Away.ogg|listen}}
*Chutting and whining are sounds made in pursuit situations, by the pursuer and pursuee, respectively. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Angry.ogg|listen}}
*A '''chattering''' sound is made by rapidly gnashing the [[tooth|teeth]], and is generally a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.
*Squealing or '''shrieking''' is a high-pitched sound of discontent, in response to pain or danger. {{Audio|Guinea Pig In Distress.ogg|listen}}
*'''Chirping''', a less-common sound, likened to [[bird vocalization|bird song]], seems to be related to stress or discomfort, or when a baby guinea pig wants to be fed. Very rarely, the chirping will last for several minutes. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Chirping.ogg|listen}}

''C. porcellus'' is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from closely related species of [[cavia|cavies]], such as ''[[Brazilian Guinea Pig|C. aperea]]'', ''[[Shiny Guinea Pig|C. fulgida]]'', and ''[[Montane Guinea Pig|C. tschudii]]'', which are still commonly found in various regions of South America.&lt;ref name=weir/&gt; Studies from 2007–2010 applied molecular markers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Spotorno |first=A.

They are social, living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which, in a break with the preceding [[pig|porcine]] nomenclature, are called "pups" not "piglets"). They move together in groups ([[herd]]s) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|pp=31–32}} While they do not [[burrow]] themselves or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by [[vegetation]].{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|pp=31–32}} They [[crepuscular|tend to be most active during dawn and dusk (crepuscular)]], when it is harder for predators to spot them.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=6}}

===Domestic habitat===
[[Domestication|Domesticated]] guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations, but boars can sometimes live together. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual pigs, and testing of boars shows their [[neuroendocrine]] stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjmbr/v37n6/4930.pdf |format=PDF| last = Cohn|first = D.W.H.|title = Female Novelty and the Courtship Behavior of Male Guinea Pigs|journal = Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|volume = 37|year = 2004|pages = 847–851|doi = 10.1590/S0100-879X2004000600010|pmid = 15264028|last2 = Tokumaru|first2 = RS|last3 = Ades|first3 = C|issue = 6|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present.{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|pp=33–34}} Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=6}} Activity is scattered randomly throughout the day; aside from an avoidance of intense light, no regular [[circadian rhythm|circadian]] patterns are apparent.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=6}}

[[File:Cat and guinea pigs.jpg|thumb|This cat has accepted a pair of guinea pigs. However, the success of interspecies interaction depends on the individual animals.|alt=|330x330px]]

Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as [[bumblefoot (infection)|bumblefoot]] (ulcerative pododermatitis).{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=63–64}} "Cubes and [[Coroplast]]" (C&amp;C) style cages are now a common choice.&lt;ref name=ygph&gt;{{cite web|title = Your Guinea Pigs' Home|publisher = Guinea Pig Cages|url = http://www.guineapigcages.com|accessdate = 2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material. Bedding made from red cedar ([[Eastern redcedar|Eastern]] or [[Western redcedar|Western]]) and [[pine]], both [[softwood]]s, were commonly used in the past, but these materials are now believed to contain harmful [[phenol]]s (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=34}} Safer bedding materials made from [[hardwood]]s (such as [[aspen]]), paper products, and corn cob materials are other alternatives.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=34}} Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their [[urine]] sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove.{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|pp=44, 49}} After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory.&lt;ref name=nrc&gt;{{cite book|last = National Resource Council|title = Laboratory Animal Management: Rodents|publisher = National Academy Press|year = 1996|pages = 72–73|isbn = 0-309-04936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.

Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species. Housing guinea pigs with other rodents such as [[gerbil]]s and [[hamster]]s may increase instances of respiratory and other infections,{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=122}} and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig.{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|p=19}} Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as [[predation|prey]], though some (such as dogs or cats) can be trained to accept them.&lt;ref name=behrend&gt;{{cite book|last = Behrend|first = Katrin|title = Guinea Pigs: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual|year = 1998|publisher = Barron's|pages = 22–23|isbn = 0-7641-0670-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and [[domestic rabbit]]s. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage.&lt;ref name=behrend/&gt;{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|p=20}} However, as [[Lagomorpha|lagomorphs]], rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=41}} Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from ''[[Bordetella]]'' and ''[[Pasteurella]]''), to which guinea pigs are susceptible.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|pp=126–128}} Even a [[dwarf rabbit]] is much stronger than a guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.&lt;ref name=gpc&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.guineapigcages.com/rabbits.htm|title = Rabbits &amp; Other Pets|publisher = Guinea Pig Cages|accessdate = 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
[[File:Cavy eating grass.jpg|thumb|right|A silver [[Agouti (coloration)|agouti]] guinea pig eating grass]]

The guinea pig's natural diet is [[grass]]; their [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout their life.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=228}} Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract; guinea pigs have much longer [[Colon (anatomy)|colons]] than most rodents, but they must also [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] their diet by eating their feces ([[coprophagia|coprophagy]]) .{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=50–51}} However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called [[cecotrope]]s (or caecal pellets), which recycle [[B vitamins]], fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=236}} The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=41}} They share this behaviour with [[rabbit]]s. In geriatric boars or sows (rarely in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak. This creates a condition known as "anal impaction", which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=52}} The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus.

Guinea pigs benefit from a diet of fresh [[grass hay]], such as [[Timothy-grass|timothy hay]], in addition to [[food pellets]] which are often based on timothy hay. [[Alfalfa]] hay is also a popular food choice and most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it,{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=8}}{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=32}} though some controversy exists over offering alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a [[legume]] rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to [[obesity]], as well as [[bladder stone (animal)|bladder stones]] from the excess [[calcium]] in all animals except for pregnant and very young guinea pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health, Care, and Diet for a Guinea pig|url = http://www.lakehowellanimalclinic.com/html/guinea_pig.html|publisher = Lake Howell Animal Clinic|accessdate = 2007-02-16|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070703103120/http://www.lakehowellanimalclinic.com/html/guinea_pig.html|archivedate = 2007-07-03|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Guinea Pigs Care Sheet|url = http://www.canyonlakevet.com/guinea-pig.htm|publisher = Canyon Lake Veterinary Hospital|accessdate = 2007-04-02|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928224848/http://www.canyonlakevet.com/guinea-pig.htm|archivedate = 2007-09-28|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a food source that can replenish protein, [[amino acid]]s, and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Institute for Laboratory Animal Research]]|title = Nutrient Requirements of Laboratory Animals|edition = 4th|publisher = National Academies Press|year = 1995|page = 106|url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4758&amp;page=106|isbn = 0-309-05126-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=236}}{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=39}}

Like humans, but unlike most other [[mammal]]s, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own [[vitamin C]] and must obtain this vital [[nutrient]] from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal [[scurvy]]. Guinea pigs require about 10&amp;nbsp;mg of vitamin C daily (20&amp;nbsp;mg if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements or by eating fresh [[Animal feed#Fodder|pellets]] designed for guinea pigs, if they have been handled properly.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=92}} Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], and [[hydrogen ion]]s; but adequate amounts of vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], and [[Vitamin E|E]] are also necessary.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=40}}

[[File:Guinea Pig eating apple.JPG|thumb|A short-haired guinea pig eating a piece of apple|alt=|left]]

Poor diets for guinea pigs have been associated with [[muscular dystrophy]], [[metastatic calcification]], difficulties with pregnancy, [[vitamin deficiencies]], and teeth problems.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|pp=237–257}}{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=89–91}} Guinea pigs tend to be [[Picky eating|fickle eaters]] when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables after having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their eating habits may be difficult to change after maturity.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=236}}{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=88–89}} They do not respond well to sudden changes in their diet and they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types.&lt;ref name="harkness" /&gt; A constant supply of hay is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present, such as chewing on their hair.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=89}} Because their teeth grow constantly (as do their nails, like humans), they routinely [[wikt:gnaw|gnaw]] on things, lest their teeth become too large for their jaw (a common problem in [[rodent]]s).&lt;ref name="ygph" /&gt; Guinea pigs chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber, if they are available.

A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including [[bracken]], [[Bryonia|bryony]], [[ranunculus|buttercup]], [[sinapis arvensis|charlock]], [[atropa belladonna|deadly nightshade]], [[digitalis|foxglove]], [[hellebore]], [[conium|hemlock]], [[lily of the valley]], [[Anthemis cotula|mayweed]], [[aconitum|monkshood]], [[privet]], [[Senecio|ragwort]], [[rhubarb]], [[veronica arvensis|speedwell]], toadflax (both ''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' and ''[[Linaria dalmatica]]''), and [[vallisneria americana|wild celery]].{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=93}} Additionally, any plant which grows from a [[bulb]] (e.g., [[tulip]] or [[onion]]) is normally considered poisonous,{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=3}} as well as ivy and oak tree leaves. A guinea pig may or may not eat poisonous material.

==Reproduction==
[[File:Fat Adie pictures 001.jpg|thumb|right|Pregnant sow one week before delivering three pups]]

Males reach sexual maturity in 3–5 weeks, while females can be fertile as early as 4 weeks old, and can carry litters before they are adults.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=15–16}} The female guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with spring being the peak. A sow can have as many as five litters in a year, but six is theoretically possible&lt;!-- 360/60 --&gt;.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; Unlike the offspring of most [[rodents]], which are [[altricial]] at birth, newborn cavy pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight.&lt;ref name=harkness/&gt; The pups are immediately mobile and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to [[breastfeeding|suckle]].  Females can once again become pregnant 6–48 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be constantly pregnant.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=17–18}}

The [[gestation]] period lasts from {{Convert|59|day|month}} to {{Convert|72|day|month}}, with an average of 63–68 days.&lt;ref name="nrc" /&gt; Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and [[eggplant]]-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies depending upon the size of the litter. [[Litter (animal)|Litter]] size ranges from one to six, with three being the average;{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=}} the largest recorded litter size is 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year = 2007|title = Guinness Book of World Records|publisher = Guinness World Records Ltd.|page = 127|isbn = 978-1-904994-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 pups.&lt;ref name="Merck Veterinarian Manual, 2016"&gt;[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/all-other-pets/guinea-pigs/breeding-and-reproduction-of-guinea-pigs Breeding and Reproduction of Guinea Pigs], Merck Veterinarian Manual, Katherine E.

&lt;!-- Complications --&gt;
[[File:Guinea baby 1.jpg|thumb|Guinea pig pup at eight hours old|alt=|left]]

[[pre-eclampsia|Toxemia of pregnancy]] (hypertension) is a common problem and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include: [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], [[Lethargy|lack of energy]], [[Salivation|excessive salivation]], a [[Bad breath|sweet or fruity breath odor]] due to [[ketone]]s, and [[seizure]]s in advanced cases.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=20–21}} Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=20}} Other serious complications during pregnancy can include a [[prolapse|prolapsed uterus]], [[hypocalcaemia]], and [[mastitis]].{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=25–29}}

Females that do not give birth may develop an irreversible fusing of the [[pubic symphysis]], a joint in the [[pelvis]], due to calcification which may occur between 6 and 10 months of age.&lt;ref name=nrc/&gt;{{rp|73|date=November 2012}}{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=16}} If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will probably not widen sufficiently and this may lead to [[dystocia]] and death as they attempt to give birth.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=25–26}} Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis if not bred is greatly overstated. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like [[ochronosis]].

Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap. While male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a similar shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=14, 17}} The male's [[testes]] may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.

==Health problems==
Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include [[Lower respiratory tract infection|respiratory tract infections]], [[diarrhea]], scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), [[abscess]]es due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by [[louse|lice]], [[mite]]s, or [[fungus]].{{sfn|Richardson|2000|loc=ch. 1, 4, 5, 9}}

Mange mites (''Trixacarus caviae'') are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and, in some instances, seizures.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=3–4}} Guinea pigs may also suffer from "running lice" (''Gliricola porcelli''), a small, white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; their eggs, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as "static lice". Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as [[ovarian cyst]]s.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=55}}

Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to [[corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcer]].{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=69–70}} Hay or straw dust can also cause [[sneeze|sneezing]]. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of [[pneumonia (non-human)|pneumonia]], especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by [[torticollis]] and can be fatal.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=45–48}}

Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=6}} Its normal [[thermoregulation|body temperature]] is {{convert|101|–|104|F|C}},{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=19}}  so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about {{convert|65|–|75|F|C}}.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=6}} Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of {{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} have been linked to [[hyperthermia]] and death, especially among pregnant sows.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=6}} Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts,{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=37}} and respond poorly to extremes of [[humidity]] outside of the range of 30–70%.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|p=36}}

Guinea pigs are [[Predation|prey]] animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]], which kill off the [[gut flora|intestinal flora]] and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=229}}{{sfn|Richardson|2000|pages=105–106}}

Similar to the inherited [[genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] of other breeds of animal (such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] in canines), a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the [[roan (color)#Roan Guinea Pigs|roan]] coloration of [[Abyssinian guinea pig|Abyssinian]] guinea pigs is associated with [[congenital disorder|congenital]] eye disorders and problems with the digestive system.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|page=69}} Other genetic disorders include "waltzing disease" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]], and [[tremor]] conditions.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = Roy|contribution = The Guinea Pig, ''Cavia Porcellus''|editor-last = King|editor-first = Robert C|title = Handbook of Genetics|volume = 4|year = 1974|pages = 275–307|publisher = Plenum|isbn = 0-306-37614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling, temperament and socialization===
If handled correctly early in life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch.&lt;ref name=harkness/&gt; They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself.{{sfn|Vanderlip|2003|p=20}} Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.lefigaro.fr/suisse/2011/08/en-suisse-les-animaux-domestiques-doivent-etre-en-couple.html |title=En Suisse, les animaux domestiques doivent obligatoirement être en couple |last1=Maurisse |first1=Marie |date=17 August 2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance, coat and grooming===
[[File:Black-haired Peruvian guinea pig.JPG|thumb|Black [[Silkie guinea pig]]]]

[[Domestication|Domesticated]] guinea pigs occur in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the [[Abyssinian guinea pig|Abyssinian]], whose coat is ruffled with [[cowlick]]s, or [[rosette (zoology)|rosettes]]. Also popular among breeders are the [[Guinea pig breed#Peruvian|Peruvian]] and the [[Guinea pig breed#Silkie or Sheltie|Sheltie]] (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the [[Guinea pig breed#Texel|Texel]], a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Guinea Pigs: The Right Pet for You?|journal=The Humane Society of the United States|date=April 21, 2010|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/guinea_pigs/tips/guinea_pigs_as_pets.html|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clubs and associations===
[[File:Rene the long-haired Satin Peruvian Guinea pig.jpg|thumb|right|A lilac, orange, and white [[Satin guinea pig|satin]] [[Peruvian guinea pig]] with a show-length coat]]

Cavy clubs and associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the [[American Rabbit Breeders' Association]], is the governing body in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution |url=http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html |publisher=American Cavy Breeders Association |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2007-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405184705/http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Cavy Council]] governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cavycouncil.org.au/|title = Official Website|publisher = Australian National Cavy Council|accessdate = 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Council).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nzcavycouncil.org.nz/ |title = Official Website|publisher = New Zealand Cavy Council|accessdate = 2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each club publishes its own standard of perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.

===Allergies to guinea pigs===
[[Allergy|Allergic]] symptoms, including [[rhinitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], and [[asthma]], have been documented in laboratory animal workers who come into contact with guinea pigs.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Severe Allergic Reactions to Guinea Pig|journal= |date=October 27, 2005|volume=3|issue=2005|pages=14|pmc=1282583|author1=Zacharisen|first1=M.

==In popular culture and media==
As a result of their widespread popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in [[literature]] include the short story "[[Pigs Is Pigs]]" by [[Ellis Parker Butler]], which is a tale of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are "pigs" or "pets" for the purpose of determining freight charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Butler|first = Ellis Parker|title = Pigs is Pigs|publisher = McClure, Phillips &amp; Co|year = 1906|isbn = 0-585-07104-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler's story, in turn, inspired the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]", written by [[David Gerrold]].&lt;ref&gt;Star Trek: the Original Series, [[Blu-ray]] edition, Season 2, Disc 4: "The Trouble with Tribbles", CBS Home Video: Catalog No. 07176&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Golden Hamster Saga]] books, two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso are modern-day thespians (named after [[Enrico Caruso]]) who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, [[Freddy Auratus]], who strongly dislikes their acting antics.

===In children's literature===
''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'', a novel by [[Beatrix Potter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Potter|first = Beatrix|title = The Fairy Caravan|year = 1929|publisher = David McKay Co|isbn = 0-7232-4044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Bond]]'s [[Olga da Polga]] series for children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Tales of Olga da Polga|publisher = Macmillan|year = 2001|isbn = 0-19-275130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; both feature guinea pigs as the [[protagonist]]. Another appearance is in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]]: in the first (chronologically) of his ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the [[Wood between the Worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lewis|first = C.S.|title = The Magician's Nephew|publisher = Macmillan|year = 1955|isbn = 1-56179-702-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ursula Dubosarsky]]'s ''Maisie and the Pinny Gig'', a little girl has a recurrent dream about a giant guinea pig, while guinea pigs feature significantly in several of Dubosarsky's other books, including the young adult novel ''The White Guinea Pig'' and ''The Game of the Goose''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin.com.au/contributors/523/ursula-dubosarsky Ursula Dubosarsky]. penguin.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===In film and television===
Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television. In the TV movie ''[[Shredderman Rules]]'', the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which play a minor part in the plot. A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by [[Chris Rock]], was a prominent character in the 1998 film ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'', and Linny the Guinea pig is a co-star on [[Nick Jr. (TV channel)|Nick Jr.]]'s ''[[Wonder Pets]]''. Guinea pigs were used in some major [[advertising|advertising campaigns]] in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for [[Egg Banking|Egg Banking plc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/32433910/slogan-doctor-egg-you-know-where-you-are-egg|title = Slogan Doctor Egg: 'You know where you are with egg'|author=Morrish, John|publisher = Management Today|accessdate = 2011-07-18|date=May 2008|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snapple]], and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = LaMonica|first = Paul|title = Super Bowl Ads, Like the Game, Disappoint|publisher = CNNMoney|url = http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/05/news/companies/superbowlads/index.htm|date = 2007-02-05|accessdate = 2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blockbuster campaign is considered by some guinea pig advocates to have been a factor in the rise of caging guinea pigs and rabbits together.&lt;ref name=gpc/&gt; In the ''[[South Park]]'' [[South Park (season 12)|season 12]] episode "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]", giant guinea pigs dressed in costumes rampage over the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;According to the "Commentary Mini" for the episode, the "costumes" for the guinea pigs were not created by South Park Studios, but rather had been ordered on line from a woman who makes them. "Commentary Mini" for Episode 11, Season 12: ''Pandemic 2: the Startling''&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] movie ''[[G-Force (film)|G-Force]]'' features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.S. government. A video game based on the movie was also released. A guinea pig named Bugsy appears in the 2008 film ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]''. A guinea pig named Cashew features prominently in the second season of the U.S. adaptation of ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.

[[File:Guinea pigs and corn.jpg|thumb|upright|''Cuy'' being raised at home in the traditional Andean fashion]]

Guinea pigs (called ''cuy'', ''cuye'', or ''curí'') were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=47}} It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the [[Geography of Ecuador#La Sierra (the highlands)|Sierra]]) and in Colombia,{{sfn|Morales|1995|pages=xxvi, 4, 32}} exclusively in highland locations in the department of Nariño near the border with Ecuador. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional [[livestock]] and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite journal|last = Nuwanyakpa|first = M.|title = The current stage and future prospects of guinea pig production under smallholder conditions in West Africa|journal = Livestock Research for Rural Development|date=November 1997|volume = 9|issue = 5|url = http://www.lrrd.org/lrrd9/5/gp951.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-16|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.{{sfn|Morales|1995|pages=32–43}}

Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year, and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the [[Last Supper]] in the [[Cusco Cathedral|main cathedral in Cusco]] shows [[Christ]] and the 12 disciples dining on guinea pig.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru. A religious celebration known as ''jaca tsariy'' ("collecting the cuys") is a major festival in many villages in the [[Antonio Raymondi Province|Antonio Raimondi]] province of eastern Peru, and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in [[Lima]].{{sfn|Morales|1995|pages=3, 101–112}} It is a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] event, combining elements of [[Catholicism]] and [[pre-Columbian]] religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local [[patron saint]]s.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=3}} The exact form the ''jaca tsariy'' takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a ''sirvinti'' (servant) is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock [[bullfighting|bullfight]].{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=3}}  Meals such as ''cuy chactado'' are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic [[satire]] of local politicians or important figures.{{sfn|Morales|1995|page=3}}  In the [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]] and [[Cotopaxi Province|Cotopaxi]] provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] as part of the ''Ensayo'', which is a community meal, and the ''Octava'', where ''castillos'' (greased poles) are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung.{{sfn|Morales|1995|pages=119–126}}  The Peruvian town of [[Churin]] has an annual festival which involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for a competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://itn.co.uk/89319c3295386535197a613d28bcf198.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090525000157/http://itn.co.uk/89319c3295386535197a613d28bcf198.html|archivedate= 2009-05-25|title = Peruvians Pig-Out|publisher = [[ITN]]|date = 2007-07-26|accessdate = 2007-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also guinea pig festivals held in [[Huancayo]], [[Cusco]], [[Lima]], and [[Huacho]], featuring costumes and guinea pig dishes.

The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a [[combustion]], similar to a candle burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Buchholz|first = Andrea C|last2 = Schoeller|first2 = Dale A.|title = Is a Calorie a Calorie?|url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S|journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume = 79|pages = 899S–906S |year = 2004|accessdate=2007-03-12|pmid = 15113737|issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of [[germ theory of disease|germ theory]] in the late 19th century, through the experiments of [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]], and [[Robert Koch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Guerrini|first = Anita|title = Experimenting with Humans and Animals|publisher = Johns Hopkins|year = 2003|isbn = 0-8018-7196-4|pages=98–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea pigs have been [[animals in space|launched into orbital space flight]] several times, first by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] on the [[Sputnik 9]] [[biosatellite]] of March 9, 1961 – with a successful recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Gray|first = Tara|url=https://history.nasa.gov/animals.html|title = A Brief History of Animals in Space|publisher = [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|year = 1998|accessdate = 2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]] also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://articles.cnn.com/2003-10-03/tech/china.space.timeline_1_long-march-jiuquan-satellite-china?_s=PM:TECH|title = Timeline: China's Space Quest|publisher = CNN.com|date = 2004-01-05|accessdate = 2007-05-03|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120121112706/http://articles.cnn.com/2003-10-03/tech/china.space.timeline_1_long-march-jiuquan-satellite-china?_s=PM%3ATECH|archivedate = 2012-01-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]], the term "guinea pig" is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This dates back to the early 20th century; the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Guinea-pig|publisher = Oxford English Dictionary online (subscription access required)|url = http://dictionary.oed.com|accessdate = 2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Consumers Research]] founders [[F. J. Schlink]] and [[Arthur Kallet]] wrote a book entitled ''[[100,000,000 Guinea Pigs]]'', extending the metaphor to consumer society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Kallet|first = Arthur|last2 = Schlink|first2 = F. J.|title = 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs: Dangers in Everyday Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics|publisher = Vanguard Press|year = 1933|isbn = 978-0-405-08025-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the [[consumer protection]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = McGovern|first = Charles|contribution = Consumption|editor-last = Whitfield|editor-first = Stephen J.|title = A Companion to 20th-Century America|year = 2004|page = 346|publisher = Blackwell|isbn = 0-631-21100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] [[Archibald McIndoe]] established the [[Guinea Pig Club]] at [[Queen Victoria Hospital]], [[East Grinstead]], Sussex, England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients, who were undergoing previously-untested reconstruction procedures. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel ''The Guinea Pigs'' (1970) by [[Czechs|Czech]] author [[Ludvík Vaculík]] as an allegory for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Vaculík|first = Ludvík|title = The Guinea Pigs|publisher = Third Press|year = 1973|isbn = 978-0-89388-060-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century: about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=gad&gt;{{cite book|last = Gad|first = Shayne C.|title = Animal Models in Toxicology|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 2007|edition = 2nd|pages = 334–402|isbn = 0-8247-5407-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=harkness/&gt; As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals.&lt;ref name=gad/&gt; In the past, they were widely used to standardize [[vaccine]]s and [[antiviral drug|antiviral agents]]; they were also often employed in studies on the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] in response to extreme [[allergy|allergic reactions]], or [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref name=reid&gt;{{cite book|last = Reid|first = Mary Elizabeth|title = The Guinea Pig in Research|year = 1958|publisher = Human Factors Research Bureau|pages = 62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less common uses included research in [[pharmacology]] and [[irradiation]].&lt;ref name=reid/&gt; Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists [[William Ernest Castle|W. E. Castle]] and [[Sewall Wright]] made a number of contributions to this area of study, especially regarding [[biological pigment|coat color]].&lt;ref name=robinson/&gt;{{sfn|Wagner|Manning|1976|p=100}} In 2004, the U.S.'s [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] announced plans to sequence the [[genome]] of the domestic guinea pig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = NHGRI Adds 18 Organisms to Sequencing Pipeline|url = http://www.genome.gov/12511858|publisher = [[National Institutes of Health]]|date = 2004-08-04|accessdate = 2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guinea pig was most extensively implemented in research and diagnosis of [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref name=reid/&gt; Common uses included identification of [[brucellosis]], [[Chagas disease]], [[cholera]], [[diphtheria]], [[foot-and-mouth disease]], [[glanders]], [[Q fever]], [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]], and various strains of [[typhus]].&lt;ref name=reid/&gt; They are still frequently used to diagnose [[tuberculosis]], since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria.&lt;ref name=gad/&gt; Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans and other [[primate]]s, cannot synthesize vitamin C, but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy.&lt;ref name=gad/&gt; From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the "ascorbutic factor" in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12555613 | volume=122 | issue=17 | title=[Axel Holst and Theodor Frolich—pioneers in the combat of scurvy] |date=June 2002 | journal=Tidsskr.

Guinea pig [[strain (biology)|strains]] used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains. Aside from the common American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are [[albinism|albino]], although pigmented strains are also available.{{sfn|Terril|Clemons|1998|pp=2–3}} [[Inbred strain]]s are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology.

Hairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for [[dermatology|dermatological]] studies. A hairless and [[immunodeficiency|immunodeficient]] breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman Kodak Company]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=usamriid&gt;{{cite web|last = Banks|first = Ron|url = http://netvet.wustl.edu/species/guinea/guinpig.txt|title = The Guinea Pig: Biology, Care, Identification, Nomenclature, Breeding, and Genetics|publisher = [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]] Seminar Series|date = 1989-02-17|accessdate = 2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the [[Institute Armand Frappier]] in 1978, and [[Charles River Laboratories]] has reproduced this breed for research since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criver.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/rm_rm_c_IAF_hairless_guinea_pigs.pdf IAF Hairless Guinea Pigs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217004412/http://www.criver.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/rm_rm_c_IAF_hairless_guinea_pigs.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}.

A '''honey super''' is a part of a [[commercial agriculture|commercial]] or other managed (such as by a hobbyist) [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]] that is used to collect [[honey]].  The most common variety is the "Illinois" or "medium" super with a depth of 6{{frac|5|8}} inches, in the length and width dimensions of a [[Langstroth hive]].

A honey super consists of a box in which 8–10 [[frame (beehive)|frames]] are hung.   [[Western honeybee]]s collect nectar and store the processed nectar in [[honeycomb]], which they build on the frames.  When the honeycomb is full, the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17-18% moisture content before capping the comb with [[beeswax]].

[[Beekeeping|Beekeepers]] will take the full honey supers and extract the honey.  Periods when there is an abundant [[nectar source]] available and bees are quickly bringing back the [[nectar]], are called a [[honey flow]].  During a honey flow, beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space.

Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted, and before the hive is winterized, but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during winter.

A '''dzo''' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] མཛོ་ mdzo) (also spelled '''zo''', '''zho''' and '''dzho''') is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between the [[yak]] and domestic [[cattle]]. The word dzo technically refers to a male hybrid, while a female is known as a ''dzomo'' or ''zhom''. In [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] it is called '''khainag''' (хайнаг). There is also the English language [[wikt:Portmanteau word|portmanteau term]] of '''yattle''', a combination of the words yak and cattle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/10/AR2007081002119.html |title=Yattle What? |last=Mummolo |first=Jonathan |date=August 11, 2007 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=January 3, 2017 |quote=Mentzer, who grew up farming in Loudoun County, and his partner, Jim Dumbrell, a retired British oil and gas pipeline consultant, are breeding yattle -- a cross between cows and yaks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as '''yakow''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=National Research Council |author-link=National Research Council (United States) |date=1983 |title=Little-Known Asian Animals With a Promising Economic Future |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/19514/little-known-asian-animals-with-a-promising-economic-future |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The National Academies Press |page=34 |doi= 10.17226/19514 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Ian | |editor-last=Porter |editor-first=Valerie |date=March 2002 |title=Mason's World Dictionary of Livestock Breeds, Types and Varieties |url=http://www.cabi.org/bookshop/book/9780851994307 |location=West Sussex |publisher=[[CABI (organisation)|CABI]] |page=122 |isbn=085199430X }}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of the words yak and cow.

Dzomo are [[fertility|fertile]] (or, [[fecundity|fecund]]) while dzo are [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]].

Dzomo can be [[backcrossing|back crossed]]. As a result, many supposedly pure yak or pure cattle probably carry each other's genetic material. In [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]], the result of a khainag crossed with either a domestic bull or yak bull is called ''ortoom'' (three-quarter-bred) and an ''ortoom'' crossed with a domestic bull or yak bull results in a ''usan güzee'' (one-eighth-bred).&lt;ref name="son"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110004313817/en Takase Hisabumi, Kh.

A '''hinny''' is a [[domestication|domestic]] equine [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] that is the offspring of a male [[horse]], a [[stallion]], and a female [[donkey]], a jenny. It is the [[reciprocal cross]] to the more common [[mule]], which is the product of a male donkey, a jack, and a female horse, a [[mare]].

==Description==
Hinnies on average are slightly smaller than mules in part because donkeys are generally smaller than horses, and growth potential of equine offspring is influenced by the size of the dam's womb. There is debate over whether this is the only reason for the size variances between the two types of hybrid equines.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--if you can find any research, here's a good spot to say so--&gt; Some enthusiasts believe this size difference is only [[physiology|physiological]], owing to the smaller size of the [[donkey]] dam,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} as compared to mares, which are generally much larger. Others{{who|date=August 2015}} claim it is a natural consequence of the reciprocal cross.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--may want to source that--&gt; The position of the [[American Donkey and Mule Society]] (ADMS) is: "The genetic inheritance of the hinny is exactly the same as the mule."&lt;ref name=LongearLingo&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |date=May 22, 2013 |title=Longear Lingo |url=http://www.lovelongears.com/longearlingo.html |website=lovelongears.com |publisher=American Donkey and Mule Society |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like mules, hinnies do come in many sizes. This is because donkeys come in many sizes, from miniatures, as small as {{convert|24|in|cm hands|0}} at the [[withers]], to [[American Mammoth Donkey]]s that may be over {{hands|15}} at the withers. Thus, a hinny is restricted to being about the size of the largest breed of donkey. Mules, however, have a female horse as a parent, so they can be as large as the size of the largest breed of horse, such as those [[foal]]ed from work horse mares such as the [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Other than size, some additional minor differences occur that can be used to distinguish between mules and hinnies. The head of a hinny is said to resemble that of a horse more than it does a mule's, with shorter ears (although these are still longer than those of horses), and more horse-like manes and tails than mules.&lt;ref name=LongearLingo/&gt;  A male hinny is properly called a ''horse hinny'', and a female hinny is properly called a ''mare hinny'', though in [[British English]] both female hinnies and female donkeys are sometimes called ''jennets''.&lt;ref name=LongearLingo/&gt;

== Fertility, sterility, and rarity ==
Hinnies are difficult to obtain because of the differences in the number of [[chromosome]]s of the horse and the [[donkey]]. A donkey has 62 chromosomes, whereas a horse has 64. Hinnies, being hybrids of those two [[species]], have 63 chromosomes and are [[infertile|sterile]]. The uneven number of chromosomes results in an incomplete [[reproductive system]]. According to the ADMS: "The equine hybrid is easier to obtain when the lower chromosome count, the donkey, is in the male. Therefore breeding for hinnies is more hit-and-miss than breeding for mules."&lt;ref name=LongearLingo/&gt;&lt;!--any scientific research on this?--&gt;

The male hinny or mule can and will mate, but the emission is not [[fertility|fertile]].  Male hinnies and [[mule]]s are usually castrated to help control their behavior by eliminating their interest in females.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Female hinnies and mules are not customarily spayed, and may or may not go through [[estrus]]. Female mules have been known, on rare occasions, to produce offspring when mated to a horse or donkey, although this is extremely uncommon. Since 1527, sixty cases of foals born to female mules around the world have been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kay |first=Katty |date=2002-10-02 |title=Morocco's miracle mule |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2290491.stm |newspaper= |location= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to the ADMS, there is only one known case of a female hinny doing so.

Namely, in [[China]], in 1981, a hinny mare proved fertile with a donkey sire. When the Chinese hinny was bred to a jack, she produced the so-called "Dragon Foal", which resembled a donkey with mule-like features.&lt;ref name=FertileMule1985&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rong |first1=Ruizhang |last2=Cai |first2=Huedi |last3=Yang |first3=Xiuqin |last4=Wei |first4=Jun |date=October 1985 |title=Fertile mule in China and her unusual foal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1289946/pdf/jrsocmed00204-0031.pdf |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=821–25 |doi= |accessdate=2014-07-13 |pmc=1289946 |pmid=4045884}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Morocco]], in 2002, a mule mare bred to a donkey sire produced a male foal.&lt;ref name=Kay2002&gt;{{cite news |last=Kay |first=Katty |date=October 2, 2002 |title=Morocco's miracle mule |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2290491.stm |newspaper= |location= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA testing revealed the foal has a mixed [[karyotype]] hybrid like the Chinese hinny offspring "Dragon Foal".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Hinnies are rare for many other reasons. Donkey jennies and horse stallions can be choosier about their mates than horse mares and donkey jacks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Thus, the two parties involved may not even care to mate. Even if they do cooperate, donkey jennies are less likely to conceive when bred to a horse stallion than horse mares are when bred to a donkey jack. [[Horse breeding|Breeding]] large hinnies is an even bigger challenge, as it requires stock from a jenny of large size, such as the [[Baudet de Poitou]] or [[American Mammoth Donkey]]. Mammoth donkey stock is becoming increasingly rare and has been declared an endangered domestic breed. Fanciers are unlikely to devote a Mammoth jenny's valuable breeding time to producing sterile hinny hybrids, when Mammoth jennies are in high demand to produce fertile purebred Mammoth foals.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Keeping '''crickets as pets''' emerged in [[China]] in early antiquity. Initially, [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] were kept for their "songs" ([[stridulation]]). In the early 12th century the [[Chinese people]] began holding [[Cricket fighting|cricket fights]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 79, discusses another theory dating cricket fights to the 8th century. However, the earliest ''reliable'' evidence is dated 12th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial era]] the Chinese also kept pet [[cicada]]s and [[grasshopper]]s, but crickets were the favorites in the [[Forbidden City]] and with the commoners alike. The art of selecting and breeding the finest fighting crickets was perfected during the [[Qing dynasty]] and remained a monopoly of the imperial court until the beginning of the 19th century.

The Imperial patronage promoted the art of making elaborate cricket containers and individual cricket homes. Traditional Chinese cricket homes come in three distinct shapes: wooden cages, ceramic jars, and [[gourd]]s. Cages are used primarily for trapping and transportation. Gourds and ceramic jars are used as permanent cricket homes in winter and summer, respectively. They are treated with special mortar to enhance the apparent loudness and tone of a cricket's song. The imperial gardeners grew custom-shaped [[Molding (process)|molded]] gourds tailored to each species of cricket. Their trade secrets were lost during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]], but crickets remain a favorite pet of the Chinese to the present day. The Japanese pet cricket culture, which emerged at least a thousand years ago, has practically vanished during the 20th century.

Chinese cricket culture and cricket-related business is highly seasonal. Trapping crickets in the fields peaks in August and extends into September. The crickets soon end up at the markets of [[Shanghai]] and other major cities. Cricket fighting season extends until the end of autumn, overlapping with the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] and the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]]. Chinese breeders are striving to make cricket fighting a year-round pastime, but the seasonal tradition prevails.

Modern Western sources recommend keeping pet crickets in transparent jars or small [[terrarium]]s providing at least two inches of soil for burrowing and containing egg-crate shells or similar objects for shelter.&lt;ref name="Amato, pp. 43–44"&gt;Amato, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; A cricket's life span is short: Development from an egg to [[imago]] takes from one to two months. The imago then lives for around one month. Cricket hobbyists have to frequently replace aging insects with younger ones which are either specifically bred for cricket fighting or caught in the wild. This makes crickets less appealing as pets in Western countries. The speed of growth, coupled with the ease of breeding and raising [[larva]]e, makes industrial-grown crickets a preferred and inexpensive food source for pet birds, reptiles, and spiders.

==Cricket biology==
[[File:Chinese crickets.jpg|thumb|Crickets as pets]]
[[File:Gryllus01.jpg|thumb|right|A male field cricket "sings" facing the entrance into his burrow, which serves as a [[resonator]].&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Field cricket Gryllus pennsylvanicus.ogg|"Song" of ''Gryllus&lt;br&gt;pennsylvanicus''}}]]
{{further|Cricket (insect)}}

True crickets are insects of the ''Gryllidae'', a cosmopolitan [[Family (biology)|family]] of around 100 [[Genus|genera]] comprising some 800 species, belonging to the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Orthoptera]].&lt;ref name=G415&gt;Gordh et al., p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets, like other Orthoptera ([[grasshopper]]s and [[Tettigoniidae|katydids]]), are capable of producing high-pitched sound by [[stridulation]]. Crickets differ from other Orthoptera in four aspects: Crickets possess three-segmented [[Arthropod leg|tarsi]] and long [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]; their [[Tympanal organ|tympanum]] is located at the base of the front [[Arthropod leg|tibia]]; and the females have long, slender [[ovipositor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Foltz (1998). [http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/foltz/eny3005/lab1/orthopteroid/Gryllid.htm "ENY 3005 Family Identification: Orthoptera: Gryllidae"]. University of Florida. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The life cycle of a cricket usually spans no more than three months. The [[larva]]e of the [[field cricket]] hatch from eggs in 7–8 days, while those of [[Acheta domesticus]] develop in 11–12 days. Development of the larvae in a controlled, warm ({{convert|30|C}}) farm environment takes four to five weeks for all cultivated species.&lt;ref name=K103&gt;Kompantseva et al., p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fourth or fifth larval [[instar]] the wingless larvae [[Moulting|moult]] into the winged [[imago]] which lives for around one month.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p.4; Ryan et al., p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets are omnivorous, opportunistic scavengers. They feed on decaying vegetable matter and fruit, and attack weaker insects or their larvae.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Levchenko, p. 125, warns against uncontrolled feeding of crickets to spiders immediately before and during moulting. A cricket will eagerly attack a much larger but defenseless moulting spider.&lt;/ref&gt;

A male cricket "sings" by raising his wing covers ([[Tegmen|tegmina]]) above the body and rubbing their bases against each other. The wing covers of a mature male cricket have protruding, irregularly shaped veins.&lt;ref name=R34/&gt; The scraper of the left wing cover rubs against the [[File (tool)|file]] of the right wing, producing a high-pitched chirp.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Walker, (1999). [http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/crickets/adomest.html "House cricket – Acheta domesticus"]. University of Florida. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets are much smaller than the sound [[wavelength]]s that they emit, which makes them inefficient [[transducer]]s, but they overcome this disadvantage by using external natural [[resonators]]. Ground-dwelling [[field cricket]]s use their funnel-shaped burrow entrances as [[Horn (acoustic)|acoustic horns]]; ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Oecanthus burmeisteri|sv}}'' attach themselves to leaves which serve as [[Sound board (music)|soundboards]] and increase sound volume by 15 to 47 times.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 161, 165–166, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese handlers increase the apparent loudness of their captive crickets by waxing the insects' [[Tympanal organ|tympanum]] with a mixture of [[cypress]] or [[lacebark pine]] tree sap and [[cinnabar]]. A legend says that this treatment was discovered in the day of the [[Qing Dynasty]], when the Emperor's cricket, held in a cage suspended from a pine tree, was observed to develop an "unusually beautiful voice" after accidentally dipping its wings in tree sap.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 16–17; Ryan et al., pp. 22, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Entomology|Entomologists]] from [[Ivan Regen]] onward have agreed that the principal purpose of a male cricket's "song" is to attract females for [[mating]].&lt;ref&gt;Huber et al., p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berthold Laufer]] and Frank Lutz recognized the fact but noted that it was not clear why males do it continuously throughout most of their adult lives, when actual mating doesn't take much time.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 3–4; Ryan et al., pp. 3–4. Huber et al., pp. 44–46, explain that different species "sing" in different periods of the day or night, for no longer than three hours continuously.&lt;/ref&gt; More is known about the attractive mechanism of a cricket's song. Scientists exposed cricket females to [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] "cricket songs", carefully varying different acoustic parameters, and measured the degree of females' response to different sounds. They found that although each species has its own optimal [[mating call]], the repetition rate of chirp "syllables" was the single most important parameter.&lt;ref name=H55&gt;Huber et al., pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; A male's singing skills do not guarantee him instant success: other, silent, males may be waiting nearby to intercept the females he attracts.&lt;ref&gt;Huber et al., p. 46, describe this behaviour in ''[[Gryllus integer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other males may be attracted by the song and rush to the singer just as females do. When another cricket confronts a singing male, the two insects determine each other's sex by touching their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. If it turns out that both crickets are male, the contact leads to a fight.&lt;ref name=H45&gt;Huber et al., p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is a simplified model of ''[[Teleogryllus commodus]]'' behaviour. Huber et al., pp. 48–54, discuss various other means of sexual recognition in different species.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;Judge and Bonanno, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.&lt;ref&gt;Judge and Bonanno, pp. 1, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that only males sing, and only males fight, means that females have little value as pets apart from breeding. Chinese keepers feed young home-bred females to birds as soon as crickets display [[sexual dimorphism]].&lt;ref name=R5/&gt; There is one notable exception: males of ''[[Suzumushi|Homoeogryllus japonicus]]'' (''suzumushi'' or ''jin zhong'') sing only in the presence of females, so some females are spared to provide company to the males.&lt;ref name=R5&gt;Laufer, pp. 4–5; Ryan et al., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pet crickets in China==

===History===

[[File:Cricket container, lacquer over wood, Jiajing reign period.jpg|thumb|left|Lacquer cricket container, 16th century]]

The singing cricket became a domestic pet in early antiquity.&lt;ref name=H136&gt;Heiser, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestors of modern Chinese people possessed a unique attitude towards small creatures, which is preserved in present-day culture of ''flower, bird, fish, insect''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See Suga, pp. 77–78, for a review of the evolution of ''flower, bird, fish, insect'' culture.&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultures studied and conquered big game: large animals, birds, and fishes. The Chinese, according to [[Berthold Laufer|Laufer]], were more interested in insects than in all other wildlife. Insects, rather than mammals or birds, became symbols of bravery ([[mantis]]) or resurrection ([[cicada]]), and became a precious economic asset ([[Bombyx mori|silkworm]]).&lt;ref name=R9&gt;Laufer, pp. 5–6; Ryan et al., p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 500 and 200 B.C. the Chinese compiled ''[[Erya]]'', a universal encyclopedia which prominently featured insects.&lt;ref name=R69&gt;Laufer, p.6; Ryan et al., p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Affairs of the period Tsin-Tao'' (742–756) mention that "whenever the autumnal season arrives, the ladies of the palace catch crickets in small golden cages ... and during the night hearken to the voices of the insects. This custom was imitated by all the people."&lt;ref name=L10&gt;Laufer, p. 10. See also [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-09/10/content_262767.htm "Fighting won't bug these crickets"]. [[China Daily]], 2003-09-10. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest artifact identified as a cricket home was discovered in a tomb dated 960 A.D.&lt;ref name=R7&gt;Ryan et al., p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] owned a 12th-century scroll painted by Su Han-Chen depicting children playing with crickets. By this time, as evidenced in the painting, the Chinese had already developed the art of making clay cricket homes, the skills of careful handling of the insects, and the practice of tickling to stimulate them.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''reliable'' accounts of cricket fights date back to the 12th century ([[Song dynasty]]) but there is also a theory tracing cricket fights to the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (8th century).&lt;ref name=S79&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singing and fighting crickets were the favorite pets of the [[Emperor of China|Emperors of China]]. The noble pastime attracted the educated class, resulting in a wealth of medieval treatises on keeping crickets. The oldest one, ''The Book of Crickets'' (''Tsu chi king''), was written by Kia Se-Tao in the first half of the 13th century. It was followed by the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming period]] books by Chou Li-Tsin and [[Liu Tong]] and early [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]] books by Fang Hu and Chen Hao-Tse.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 6; Ryan et al., p. 11. Note that the spelling of Chinese names in Laufer's 1927 book, reproduced as-is by Ryan, may differ from modern English renditions.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yutaka Suga, cricket fighting was also popular among the commoners of [[Beijing]] and they, rather than the nobles, were "the driving force behind the amusement" during the Qing period.&lt;ref name=S79/&gt; The court, in turn, forced the commoners to collect and pay their dues in fine fighting crickets, as was retold by [[Pu Songling]] in ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio|A Cricket Boy]]'' (early 18th century). In this story, which is set in the reign of the [[Xuande Emperor]], an unfortunate peasant was given the impossible task of finding the strongest prize-fighting cricket. His cricket miraculously defeated all Emperor's insects; the ending reveals that the champion was mysteriously guided by the spirit of his own unconscious child.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 22–26; source text: Yuan, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of cricket-keeping, that of growing molded, custom-shaped [[gourd]]s destined to become cricket homes, was an exclusive monopoly of the Forbidden City. The royal gardeners would place the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] of an emerging ''[[Lagenaria]]'' fruit inside an earthen mould, forcing the fruit to take up the desired shape. The oldest surviving molded gourd, ''Hasshin Hyōko'' dated 1238, is preserved in [[Hōryū-ji]] temple in Japan. The art reached its peak in the 18th century, when the gardeners implemented reusable carved wood and disposable clay molds. The shapes of the gourds were tailored to different species of cricket: larger gourds for larger species, long-bottle gourds for the species known for long hops, and so on. Immature fruit easily reproduces the artwork carved into the mold, but also easily picks up any natural or man-made impurities. The finest craftsmen exploited, rather than concealed, these blemishes. Molded gourds were a symbol of the highest social standing. The ones held by Chinese royalty depicted in medieval portraits were actually prized cricket containers.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yongzheng Emperor]] held a gourd in his hand even when he was sleeping, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] maintained a private molded gourd garden. In the 1800s the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] lifted the monopoly on molded gourds, but they remained expensive even for the upper classes.&lt;ref name=R30&gt;Ryan et al., p. 30; Finch and Zhang, pp. 13–15, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Imperial era [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] revitalized cricket fighting by staging contests between cricket breeders.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Angi (2009). [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2009-12/26/content_9232984.htm "Empty nest"]. China Daily. 2009-12-26. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A cricket of her successor, the infant Emperor [[Puyi]], became a [[plot device]] in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s film ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987). Bertolucci presented the cricket's container as a magic [[black box]] that opens up the memories of Puyi. According to Bruce Sklarew, the cricket, mysteriously emerging from the box, carries at least three meanings: it is the [[metaphor]] of Puyi himself, it is the metaphor of his wisdom acquired through suffering, and a symbol of the ultimate freedom that comes with death.&lt;ref&gt;Sklarew, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient secrets of cricket handling and cricket-related crafts, only some of which were recorded on paper, were largely lost during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. From 1949 to 1976&lt;ref name=J211&gt;Jin and Yen, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; the Communist regime suppressed cricket keeping, which was deemed an unacceptable distraction and a symbol of the past. Cricket trade was banned altogether in the 1950s, but continued secretly even on the [[People's Square (Shanghai)|People's Square]] of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=S85&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; A dozen illegal markets emerged in the 1980s, and in 1987 the government formally allowed trading crickets on the Liuhe Road. By 1993 there were five legal markets,&lt;ref name=S85/&gt; and in the 21st century Shanghai has over 20 cricket markets.

The short life span of a cricket necessitates frequent replacement of aging insects. The crickets sold in present-day China are usually caught in the wild in remote provinces. Earlier, most crickets sold in major cities were caught in the nearby countryside, but in the 21st century a local catch, or ''dichong'', is extremely rare.&lt;ref name=S80&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of crickets sold in Shanghai in the 1990s and the 2000s came from rural [[Ningjin County, Shandong|Ningjin County]] in [[Shandong]], where cricket hunting became a second job for local peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Suga, pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Practically all people of Ningjin—men and women of all ages—engage in the cricket business.&lt;ref name=S80/&gt; A peasant usually makes around 70 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] per night, and 2000 yuan per season.&lt;ref name=S83&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A very good season can bring a family over 10,000 yuan ($1,210).&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;

Cricket catching extends over August and September. Crickets are most active between midnight and dawn.&lt;ref name=S79&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; They are agile creatures, and when distressed they quickly hide into burrows or improvised shelter, or hop and even fly away.&lt;ref name=H39&gt;Huber, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical Chinese crickets hide underground,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Burrowing crickets use funnel-shaped entrances to their nests as natural [[resonator]]s to amplify their songs. A singing cricket literally faces its own burrow and can instantly hide underground. – Huber et al., p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; so the catcher's first task is to either force or lure the insect out of its hideout. Trappers from the North of China use lighted candles to lure insects into their traps. Trappers from the South use iron cage-like lanterns or fire baskets to carry smoldering [[charcoal]] which forces insects to flee from the smoke. Other ways of forcing the insect out involve flooding their burrows or setting up juicy fruit baits.&lt;ref name=R23&gt;Laufer, pp. 12–13; Ryan et al., p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ningjin trappers use a simple tool, similar to an ice pick, for digging earth and poking under stones.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Suga, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trapper who has located a cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use ''zhao'', a soft catching net on a wire frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day.&lt;ref name=S81&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of [[bamboo]] or [[ivory]] rods.&lt;ref name=R23/&gt; Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl with a hole in its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged from the hole, the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.&lt;ref&gt;Piassetsky, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1927 book, Laufer described seven species of crickets kept by the people of Beijing; ''[[Oecanthus rufescens]]'' and ''[[suzumushi|Homeogryllys japonicus]]'' were the favorites based on their "singing" rather than fighting qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common species sold by Chinese traders in the 21st century are ''[[Anaxipha pallidula]]'', ''[[Homeoxipha lycoides]]'', ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao Changyan (2006).

Retrieved 2010-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Velarifictorus micado]]'' from Shandong is especially prized.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; Ningjin peasants collect only the ''[[Velarifictorus]]'' species and discard the abundant ''[[Teleogryllus emma]]'' and ''[[Loxoblemmus doenitzii]]'', which are not used in cricket fighting.&lt;ref name="S82"&gt;Yutaga Suga, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants usually cannot even remotely estimate the probable market value of the catch. At best, they can sort crickets by size; their objective is to sell the catch to the wholesalers as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="S82ff"&gt;Yutaga Suga, pp. 82,83,85.&lt;/ref&gt; They offload their catch at the local roadside markets (''daji'') in the early morning, immediately after the night shift. They frequently overstate their selling skills: many crickets remain unsold and are discarded.&lt;ref name=S83/&gt;

The trade is driven by urban consumers.&lt;ref name=S85/&gt; As recently as 1991, from 300,000 to 400,000 people of Shanghai engaged in cricket fighting, with around 100,000&amp;nbsp;crickets fighting every day of the August–September season.&lt;ref name=J211/&gt; Dealers from a large city normally control cricket haunts within {{convert|1000|km}} of their base.&lt;ref name=S85/&gt; The dealers and aficionados from Shanghai arrive in Ningjin in groups and lodge in the villages.

===Fighting and gambling===

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten doos op pootjes met achttien bamboe kokers voor vechtkrekels TMnr 1936-10a.jpg|thumb|right|A set of small tube-like cages for fighting crickets]]

Cricket fighting is a seasonal sport, "an autumn pastime" (''qiu xing'') that relies on the supply of wild-caught insects.&lt;ref name=ARE&gt;James T. Areddy (2003). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125935631852667013 "In Shanghai, the Autumn Game Just Isn't Cricket Anymore"]. The Wall Street Journal. December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Young crickets must mature before fighting; thus the high season begins near the autumn [[equinox]].&lt;ref name=S89/&gt; Crickets are placed in individual clay homes sprinkled with herbal medicines, bathed in [[Liquorice|licorice]] [[infusion]] every three to five days and fed according to each owner's secret recipes.&lt;ref name=S88&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional diet of captive crickets, described by Laufer, consisted of seasonal green vegetables in the summer and [[mastication|masticated]] chestnuts and yellow beans in winter. The Southern Chinese also fed their crickets chopped fish, insects and honey. Fighting crickets were given a special treatment of rice, lotus seeds, and mosquitoes, and an undisclosed herbal stimulant.&lt;ref name=L15&gt;Laufer, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The owners closely watch the cricket's behavior for signs of discomfort, and adjust the diet to bring the fighters into shape.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 18; Ryan et al., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The crickets are mated with females before the fight, as the Chinese believe that, unlike other beings, male crickets become more aggressive ''after'' having sex.&lt;ref name=S89&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In Laufer's time the fighters were sorted in three [[weight classes]]; present-day Shanghai aficionados have a system of nine classes from 0.51 to 0.74&amp;nbsp;grams. Both sides in a fight should belong to the same class, thus before the fight the crickets are weighed on high-precision scales (''huang''). The units of cricket weight, ''zun'' and ''dian'', are not used anywhere else.&lt;ref name=S90&gt;Laufer, p. 19; Yutaka Suga, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fights are held outdoors&lt;ref name=R36&gt;Ryan et al., p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; in an oval ring (''douzha''),&lt;ref name=S90/&gt; which was traditionally a flat clay pot but is more commonly a plastic container today. Crickets are stimulated with a tickler (''cao'') made of a rat's whisker hairs (Beijing style) or of fresh grass strands (Shanghai style).&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 16; Ryan et al., p. 34; Yutaka Suga, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The handler tickles the cricket's head, then the abdomen, and finally the hind legs.&lt;ref name=L19&gt;Laufer, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Each fight consists of three or five bouts; the winner must score in two of three or three of five bouts. A bout is stopped when the triumphant winner extends his wings as a sign of victory, or when his opponent flees from the action.&lt;ref name=S91&gt;Yutaka Suga, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Laufer wrote that the fights of his time usually ended in the death of one of the crickets: The winners physically beheaded their opponents.&lt;ref name=L19/&gt; Present-day fights may look vicious but are not lethal; the loser is always allowed to flee from the winner.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt;

A winning cricket progresses from fight to fight to the rank of "the General". Laufer wrote that the people of [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]] buried their dead fighting champions in tiny silver coffins. According to a local tradition, a proper burial of a "general" ensures a good catch of wild crickets.&lt;ref name=R39&gt;Laufer, pp. 20–21; Ryan et al., p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Live champion fighters sell for hundreds, rarely thousands of U.S. dollars.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; The highest price for a single cricket was recorded in 1999 at 100,000 yuan ($12,000).&lt;ref name=CD&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-09/10/content_262767.htm "Fighting won't bug these crickets"]. [[China Daily]], 2003-09-10. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest price, of around 1 yuan, is for the mute and shy females that still have some value as consorts to the fighting males. The cheapest males sell for five yuan.&lt;ref name=CD/&gt;

Betting on cricket fights is outlawed throughout the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] but widespread on the streets. In 2004 Shanghai police reported that it had raided 17,478 gambling places involving around 57,000 people. One such place specializing in cricket fights was located in an old factory building and had around 200 patrons, men in their forties and fifties, when the police arrived.&lt;ref name=P6&gt;Cao Li (2006).

===Cricket homes===

[[File:Suzumushi.jpg|thumb|left|''Suzumushi'' (''Homoeogryllus japonicus'') {{audio|Suzumushi 06z3286.ogg|Suzumushi song}}]]

Male crickets, whether held for fighting or for singing, always live in solitary individual homes or containers. Laufer in his 1927 book wrote that Chinese people sometimes hoarded hundreds of singing crickets, with dedicated cricket rooms filled with many rows of cricket homes. Such houses were filled with "a deafening noise which a Chinese is able to stand for any length of time".&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 13; Ryan et al., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Present-day cricket containers take three different shapes: cages are used for trapping and transportation, ceramic jars or pots are used in the summer and autumn, and in the winter the surviving crickets are moved into [[gourd]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden cages made of tiny rods and planks were once the most common type of insect house. The people of Shanghai and Hangzhou areas still use stool-shaped cages for keeping captive [[grasshopper]]s. Elsewhere, cages were historically used for keeping captive [[cicada]]s. They were suspended outdoors, at the eaves of the houses and from tree branches. Their use declined when the Chinese concentrated on keeping crickets. Small cages are still used for transporting crickets. Some are curved to follow the shape of a human body; crickets need warmth and prefer to be kept close to the body. The cage is placed in a ''tao'', a kind of protective [[silk]] bag, and is ideally carried in the pocket of a shirt.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan et al., pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; A special type of funnel-shaped wire mesh cage is used to temporarily contain the cricket while its main home is being cleaned.&lt;ref name=R34&gt;Laufer, p. 16; Ryan et al., p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramic jars or pots with flat lids, introduced in the Ming period, are the preferred type of container for keeping the cricket in summer. Some jars are shaped as a gourd but most are cylindrical. Thick clay walls effectively shield the cricket from excessive heat. Ceramic pots are used for raising cricket [[larva]]e until the insect matures to the point when it can be safely transported in a cage or a gourd. The bottom of the jar is filled with a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] made of clay, lime, and sand. It is levelled at a slant angle of about thirty degrees, smoothed, and dried into a shiny solid mass. In addition to shaping the cricket's habitat, it also defines the acoustic properties of a cricket house. Inside, the jar may contain a cricket "bed" or "sleeping box" (''lingfan'') made of clay, wood, or ivory, and miniature porcelain "dishes".&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, p. 14; Ryan et al., pp. 27–28; Yutaka Suga, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pet crickets spend winters in a different type of container made of a gourd (the hard-shelled fruit of ''Lagenaria vulgaris''). The bottoms of the gourds are filled with lime mortar. The carved lids can be made of [[jade]], coconut shell, sandalwood and ivory; the most common [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] employs an ornament of gourd vines, flowers, and fruits. The thickness of the lid and the configuration of vents in it are tailored to enhance the tone of a cricket's song.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, pp. 14–15; Ryan, pp. 21, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient art of growing molded gourds was lost during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when the old pastime was deemed inappropriate for Red China. 20th-century cricket enthusiasts like [[Wang Shixiang]] had to carve their gourds themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Barrass, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary cricket gourds have carved, rather than naturally molded, surfaces. Molded gourds are being slowly re-introduced since the 1990s by enthusiasts like Zhang Cairi.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan et al., p. 30; Finch and Zhang, pp. 15, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pet crickets in Japan==
[[File:Torii Kiyohiro - Three Street Vendors Selling Goods for Autumn.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese market scene by [[Torii school|Torii Kiyohiro]], around 1750. The trader on the right sells cages for crickets.]]

The two species most esteemed in Japan, according to Huber et al., are the ''Homoeogryllus japonicus'' (bell cricket, ''[[suzumushi]]'') and the ''Xenogryllus marmoratus'' (pine cricket, ''matsumushi'').&lt;ref name=H40/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Contemporary English translators renders ''suzumushi'' as ''bell cricket'', ''matsumushi'' as ''pine cricket'' – see translator's notes to ''The Tale of Genji'', pp. 445 and 1135.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lafcadio Hearn]] in his 1898 book named the third species, ''kirigirisu'' (''[[Gampsocleis mikado]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 46, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese identified and described the most musical cricket haunts centuries ago, long before they began keeping them at home.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hearn, the Japanese esteemed crickets far higher than the cicadas, which were considered "vulgar chatterers" and were never caged.&lt;ref name=HH42&gt;Hearn, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poetic description of ''matsumushi'' is credited to [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] (905 A.D.).&lt;ref name=HH61&gt;Hearn, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Suzumushi is featured in an eponymous chapter of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1000–1008 A.D.) which, according to Hearn, is the oldest Japanese account of an insect hunt.&lt;ref name=HH44&gt;Hearn, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Crickets and katydids (''mushi'') were the staple [[kigo|symbols of autumn]] in [[haiku]] poetry.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; The Western culture, unlike its Japanese counterpart, regards crickets as symbols of ''summer''. American film producers routinely insert clips of cricket sounds to tell the audience that the action takes place in summer.&lt;ref name=R42&gt;Huber, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cricket trade emerged as a full-time occupation in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; The poet [[Takarai Kikaku]] complained that he could not find any ''mushiya'' (cricket dealers) in the city of [[Edo]]; according to Hearn this meant that he ''expected'' to find such dealers there.&lt;ref name=HH46&gt;Hearn, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tokyo]] lagged behind other cities; regular trade there emerged only at the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=HH48&gt;Hearn, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A food vendor named Chuzo, who collected crickets for fun, suddenly discovered considerable demand for them among his neighbors and started trading in wild crickets.&lt;ref name=HH49&gt;Hearn, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his customers, Kiriyama, succeeded in breeding three species of crickets. He partnered with Chuzo in the business, which was "profitable beyond expectations".&lt;ref name=HH50&gt;Hearn, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Chuzo was flooded with orders and switched exclusively to wholesale operations, supplying crickets to street dealers and collecting royalties from cage makers.&lt;ref name=HH51&gt;Hearn, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Bunsei]] period the government contained competition between cricket dealers by limiting them to thirty-six, in a [[guild]] known as Ōyama-Ko (after [[Mount Ōyama (Kanagawa)|Mount Ōyama]]) or, alternatively, the Yedo Insect Company.&lt;ref name=HH53&gt;Hearn, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century cricket trade was dominated by two houses: Kawasumo Kanesaburo and his network supplied wild-caught insects, and the Yumoto house specialized in breeding crickets off-season. They dealt in twelve species of wild-caught and nine species of artificially-bred crickets.&lt;ref name=HH55&gt;Hearn, p. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition, which peaked in the 19th century, is now largely gone but crickets are still sold at pet shops.&lt;ref name=H40&gt;Huber et al., p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; A large colony of suzumushi crickets thrives at the altar of the [[Suzumushi Temple]] in [[Kyoto]]. These crickets have no particular religious significance; they are retained as a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=H41&gt;Huber et al., p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pet crickets in the West==

European naturalists studied crickets since the 18th century. [[William Gould (naturalist)|William Gould]] described feeding ant nymphs to a captive [[mole cricket]] for several months.&lt;ref&gt;Rennie, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The European approach to cricket breeding has been popularized by [[Jean-Henri Fabre]]. Fabre wrote that breeding "demands no particular preparations. A little patience is enough."&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fabre, home breeding may start as early as April or May with the capture of a couple of field crickets. They are placed in a flower pot with "a layer of beaten earth" inside, and a tightly fitting lid. Fed only with lettuce, Fabre's cricket couple laid five to six hundred eggs, and practically all of them hatched.&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crickets are a common subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large transparent jar or a small [[terrarium]] with at least two inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend [[Egg carton|egg-crate shells]]. The top of the terrarium must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.&lt;ref name=AK&gt;Amato, pp. 43–44; Kompantseva, pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking water is supplied by offering crickets a wet sponge or spraying their container, but never directly: crickets easily drown even in small dishes of water. Crickets feed on all kinds of fresh fruit and greens;&lt;ref name="Amato, pp. 43–44"/&gt; industrial breeders also feed bulk quantities of dry [[fish food]] – ''[[Daphnia]]'' and ''[[Gammarus]]''.&lt;ref name=AK/&gt; Contrary to the Eastern approach of keeping males in solitary cells, keeping males together is acceptable: According to Amato, [[protein]]-rich diet reduces the males' drive to fight.&lt;ref name=AA&gt;Amato, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial cricket farming==

[[File:Gryllus campestris 3.jpg|thumb|right|The British population of ''[[Gryllus campestris]]'' was saved from extinction through deliberate breeding at the [[London Zoo]].]]

Chinese breeders of the 21st century strive to extend the fighting season to the whole year. They advertise farm-bred "designer bugs" as super-fighters and agree that their technology is "completely counter to the natural process". However, they refuse to use [[hormone]]s or the practice of arming crickets with steel [[Implant (medicine)|implants]].&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; As of 2003, these farm-bred crickets retailed for only around $1.50 a head, ten times lower than average wild-caught Shandong cricket.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; Breeding is a risky business: Chinese cricket farms are regularly wiped out by an unknown disease.&lt;ref name=ARE/&gt; [[Mycosis|Fungal diseases]] are manageable,&lt;ref name=PK63/&gt; but crickets have no defenses against [[cricket paralysis virus]] (CrPV), which almost certainly kills the entire population. The virus was first isolated in [[Australia]] around 1970. The worst outbreak in Europe occurred in 2002. The cosmopolitan virus is carried by a multitude of invertebrate [[Host (biology)|hosts]], including [[drosophila]]e and [[honey bee]]s, which are not affected by the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Jan et al., p. 285; Christian and Scotti, pp. 305–308.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Honey bees suffer from two related but different viruses – acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), discovered in 1863. – Christian and Scotti, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all crickets farmed in the United States are ''[[Acheta domesticus]]''.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; The American cricket industry does not disclose its earnings; in 1989 Huber et al. estimated it at $3,000,000 annually.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; Most of these crickets were not pets, but [[fish bait]] and animal food. The largest shipment, of 445 metric tons, was reported by [[Purina Mills]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=H41/&gt; A decade later individual cricket farms like the Bassett Cricket Ranch in [[Visalia, California]] easily surpassed the million-dollar mark. By 1998 Bassett shipped two million crickets a week.&lt;ref name=M181&gt;Menzel and d'Aluisio, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fluker Cricket Farm in [[Louisiana]] exceeded $5,000,000 in annual sales in 2001&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough and Zimmerer, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a staple subject of American business school textbooks.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Fluker case studies are discussed in Steven P. Robbins (2001). ''Organizational Behavior''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-189095-6}}.; Garnter and Bellamy (2009). ''Enterprise''. Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|0-324-13085-6}}; Thill and Bovee (1999). ''Excellence in business communication''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-781501-8}} etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoos of the [[Old World]] breed ''Acheta domesticus'', ''[[Gryllus bimaculatus]]'', and ''[[Gryllus assimilis]]''. Their cricket farms usually rotate four generation ("four crates") of insects. One generation or one physical crate is used for mating and incubation of eggs, which takes from seven to twelve days. One male usually mates to three or four females. Females are discarded (and fed to zoo animals) immediately after laying the eggs: their life span is too short to give them a second chance. Three other generations, spaced by the same seven to twelve days, are for raising the larvae, which takes 4–5 weeks. Thus the zoos restock their live food supply practically every week.&lt;ref name=KO&gt;Kompantseva et al., pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

British zoos breed crickets in deliberate attempts to restore the nearly extinct wild populations. In the late 1980s the British population of ''[[Gryllus campestris]]'' shrunk to a single colony of around 100 individual insects. In 1991 the species became the subject of the national Species Recovery Program. Each year, three pairs of subadult crickets were caught in the wild and bred in a controlled lab environment to preserve the [[gene pool]] of the mother colony. The [[London Zoo]] raised 17,000 crickets; the field biologists laid down seven new cricket colonies, four of which survived into the 21st century. The program became a model for similar efforts in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Kelly et al, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period the London Zoo bred the more demanding [[wart-biter]] (''Decticus verrucivorus''), also resulting in the establishment of persistent colonies in the wild.&lt;ref name=PK63&gt;Pearce-Kelly et al., p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''yakalo''' is a cross of the [[yak]] (''Bos grunniens'') and the [[American bison]] (''Bison bison'', known as a buffalo in North America).

The '''domestic goat''' or simply '''goat''' (''Capra aegagrus hircus'') is a subspecies of [[C. aegagrus]] [[domesticated]] from the wild goat of [[Southwest Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. The goat is a member of the animal family [[Bovidae]] and the goat-[[antelope]] subfamily [[Caprinae]], meaning it is closely related to the [[sheep]]. There are over 300 distinct [[Breed|breeds]] of goat.&lt;ref name="hadog"&gt;Hirst, K. Kris. [http://archaeology.about.com/od/domestications/qt/goats.htm "The History of the Domestication of Goats".] ''[[About.com]]''. Accessed August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, and have been used for [[Goat milk|milk]], [[Goat meat|meat]], [[Animal fur|fur]], and [[Animal skin|skins]] across much of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Linda, Margo Hale, and Ann Wells; [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/goatoverview.html "Goats: Sustainable Production Overview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Milk from goats is often turned into [[goat cheese]].

Female goats are referred to as ''does'' or ''nannies'', [[Entire (animal)|intact]] males are called ''bucks'' or ''billies'' and juvenile goats of both sexes are called ''kids''. [[Castration|Castrated]] males are called ''wethers''.  While the words ''hircine'' and ''caprine'' both refer to anything having a goat-like quality, ''hircine'' is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats.

In 2011, there were more than 924 million goats living in the world, according to the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/home/E|publisher = United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|title = FAOSTAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Hassanelsayad_10.jpg|thumb|right|Goat-herding is an ancient tradition that is still important in places like Egypt.]]
The [[Modern English]] word ''goat'' comes from [[Old English]] ''gāt'' "she-goat, goat in general", which in turn derives from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''gaitaz'' (cf. [[Dutch language|Dutch]]/[[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''geit'', [[German language|German]] ''Geiß'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''gaits''), ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ǵʰaidos'' meaning "young goat" (cf. [[Latin]] ''haedus'' "kid"),&lt;ref&gt;Calvert Watkins et al., ''The American Heritage Dictionary'' (1975, edited by William Morris).&lt;/ref&gt; itself perhaps from a root meaning "jump" (assuming that [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''zajęcǐ'' "hare", [[Sanskrit]] ''jihīte'' "he moves" are related).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} To refer to the male, Old English used ''bucca'' (giving modern ''buck'') until ousted by ''hegote'', ''hegoote'' in the late 12th century. ''Nanny goat'' (females) originated in the 18th century and ''billy goat'' (for males) in the 19th.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild [[Bezoar ibex]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today.&lt;ref name=OKstate /&gt;

[[Neolithic]] farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to [[milk]] and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel, and their bones, hair and sinew for clothing, building and tools.&lt;ref name="hadog" /&gt; The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years [[before present]] are found in [[Ganj Dareh]] in [[Iran]]. Goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in [[Jericho]], [[Choga Mami]],&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1WOPkmChaFsC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=choga+mami+goat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DAPCktHUVm&amp;sig=HyDu9QXrdVcyJY37orgclD8ax1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w311UKHMJIrW0QXS5YHYDg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=choga%20mami%20goat&amp;f=false ''The Near East: Archaeology in the ''Cradle of Civilization''] Routledge, 1999; p.124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Djeitun]], and [[Çayönü]], dating the domestication of goats in [[Western Asia]] at between 8000 and 9000 years ago.&lt;ref name=OKstate /&gt;

Studies of DNA evidence suggests 10,000 years BP as the domestication date.&lt;ref name="Naderi et al. 17659–17664" /&gt;

Historically, goat hide has been used for water and [[wine]] bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce [[parchment]].

[[File:Goat heart 01.jpg|thumb|Goat heart. Specimen clarified for visualization of anatomical structures]]

Each recognized breed of goat has specific weight ranges, which vary from over {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} for bucks of larger breeds such as the Boer, to {{convert|45|to|60|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} for smaller goat does.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R.E. and Field, T.G., "Growth and Development" Scientific Farm Animal Production: An Introduction to Animal Science, 6th Ed. Prentice-Hall (1999) Upper Saddle River pg 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. At the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the African Pygmy, which stand {{convert|16|to|23|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Belanger, J &amp; Bredesen, S. T, "Basic Information about Goats" ''Storey's Guide to Raising Dairy Goats'', 2nd ed. Storey Publishing (2010) North Adams, pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horns===
Most goats naturally have two [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed.&lt;ref name="americangoatsociety.com"&gt;[http://www.americangoatsociety.com/education/polled_genetics.php American Goat Society:Polled Genetics], americangoatsociety.com.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been incidents of [[polycerate]] goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. Unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably [[Polled livestock|polled]], as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. Breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of [[intersex]] individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile.&lt;ref name="americangoatsociety.com" /&gt; Their horns are made of living bone surrounded by [[keratin]] and other  [[proteins]], and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.&lt;ref name="SmithSherman2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary C. Smith|author2=David M. Sherman|title=Goat Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJS9NEpYnd8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=16 November 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-119-94952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digestion and lactation===
Goats are [[ruminants]]. They have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the [[rumen]], the [[reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]], the [[omasum]], and the [[abomasum]]. As with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. The females have an [[udder]] consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R.E., ''Scientific Farm Animal Production: An Introduction to Animal Science'', 6th ed, Upper Saddle River (Prentice Hall) 1998&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to this is the [[Boer goat]], which sometimes may have up to eight teats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boergoatshome.com/genetic-goat-flaws.php|title = What is a Genetic Flaw in a Boer Goat?|date = |accessdate = November 12, 2014|website = Boer Goats Home|publisher = |last = Bowman|first = Gail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roosterridgeboergoats.com/articles/choosing-your-4h-boer-goat-doe-guide-4hers |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141112193133/http://roosterridgeboergoats.com/articles/choosing-your-4h-boer-goat-doe-guide-4hers |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |title=Choosing Your Boer Goat- How Do I Know What to Look For? |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2014 |website=Rooster Ridge Boer Goats |publisher= |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eyes===
Goats have horizontal, slit-shaped [[pupils]].  Because goats' [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and [[sclera]].

===Beards===
Both male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross [[boer goat|Boers]], and [[pygmy goat]]s) may have [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]], one dangling from each side of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripleigoats.com/faq.htm Frequently Asked Questions – Triple I Goats], tripleigoats.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Goat kid in char of Sirajganj, Bangladesh 05.jpg|thumb|left|Goat kid]] 
[[File:Domestic goat kid in capeweed.jpg|thumb|left|A two-month-old goat kid in a field of [[Arctotheca calendula|capeweed]]]]
Goats reach puberty between three and 15 months of age, depending on breed and nutritional status.  Many breeders prefer to postpone breeding until the doe has reached 70% of the adult weight.  However, this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed, open-range herds.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, William J.A., ''An Introduction to Animal Husbandry in the Tropics'', 5th ed, Oxford (Blackwell Science) 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate climates and among the Swiss breeds, the [[breeding season]] commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring or before. In equatorial regions, goats are able to [[mating|breed]] at any time of the year. Successful breeding in these regions depends more on available forage than on day length. Does of any breed or region come into [[estrus]] (heat) every 21 days for two to 48 hours. A doe in heat typically flags (vigorously wags) her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat.
[[File:Grenadine Goat and Kids.jpg|thumb|right|A female goat and two kids]]
Bucks (intact males) of Swiss and northern breeds come into [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] in the fall as with the does' heat cycles. Bucks of equatorial breeds may show seasonal reduced fertility, but as with the does, are capable of breeding at all times. Rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does. A buck in rut will display [[flehmen]] lip curling and will [[Self-anointing in animals#Ungulates|urinate on his forelegs and face]]. Sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goat's odor, which is important to make him attractive to the female.  Some does will not mate with a buck which has been descented.&lt;ref name="SmithSherman2011"/&gt;

In addition to natural, traditional mating, [[artificial insemination]] has gained popularity among goat [[breeder]]s, as it allows easy access to a wide variety of [[bloodline]]s.

[[Gestation]] length is approximately 150 days. [[Twins]] are the usual result, with single and [[multiple birth|triplet]] births also common. Less frequent are litters of [[quadruplet]], [[quintuplet]], and even [[sextuplet]] kids. Birthing, known as kidding, generally occurs uneventfully. Just before kidding, the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip, as well as heavy breathing. She may have a worried look, become restless and display great affection for her keeper. The mother often [[placentophagy|eats the placenta]], which gives her much-needed nutrients, helps stanch her bleeding, and parallels the behavior of wild [[herbivores]], such as deer, to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Freshening (coming into milk production) occurs at kidding. Milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between {{convert|1,500|and|4,000|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} of milk per 305-day [[lactation]]. On average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least {{convert|6|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of milk per day while she is in milk. A first-time milker may produce less, or as much as {{convert|16|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, or more of milk in exceptional cases. After the lactation, the doe will "dry off", typically after she has been bred. Occasionally, goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical 305 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dairygoatjournal.com/issues/84/84-6/Tim_King.html|title=Dairy Goat Journal. - raising goats – goat business|work=dairygoatjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meat, fiber, and [[pet]] breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until [[weaning]].

==Diet==
Goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, including tin cans and [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] boxes. While goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are [[Browsing (predation)|browsing]] animals, not [[grazers]] like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and paper (such as labels from tin cans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsgra.com/PDF-files/secogoats.pdf |title=Learning About Goats |publisher=Texas Department of Agriculture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222062352/http://www.tsgra.com/PDF-files/secogoats.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes may further stimulate their curiosity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Domestic goat feeding on capeweed.jpg|thumb|A domestic goat feeding in a field of capeweed, a weed which is toxic to most stock animals]] Aside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant. However, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which are otherwise toxic.&lt;ref&gt;"War on Weeds," ''Rails to Trails Magazine,'' Spring 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; They will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing [[starvation]]. This is one reason goat-rearing is most often [[Free range|free ranging]], since stall-fed goat-rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable.

Goats prefer to browse on [[vine]]s, such as [[kudzu]], on [[shrubbery]] and on [[weed]]s, more like deer than sheep, preferring them to grasses. [[Nightshade]] is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats. [[Silage]] (fermented corn stalks) and haylage (fermented grass hay) can be used if consumed immediately after opening&amp;nbsp;– goats are particularly sensitive to ''[[Listeria]]'' bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds. [[Alfalfa]], a high-protein plant, is widely fed as [[hay]]; [[fescue]] is the least palatable and least nutritious hay. [[Mold]] in a goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it.

In various places in China, goats are used in the production of tea.  Goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves (which contain bitter tasting substances) but instead eat the weeds.  The goats' droppings fertilise the tea plants.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild China'' A BBC2 programme transmitted on October 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) is essentially the same as that of a [[monogastric]] animal. Milk digestion begins in the [[abomasum]], the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling. At birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients.

The adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed (genetic potential) and its diet while growing (nutritional potential). As with all [[livestock]], increased protein diets (10 to 14%) and sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than lower protein rates and limited calories.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, D.G. and Rankins, D. L. Jr, "Feeding and Nutrition" [https://books.google.com/books?id=s-Z311q6CIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Feeding%20and%20nutrition%22&amp;f=false Sheep and Goat Medicine, 2nd Ed.] Elsevier (2012) Maryland Heights, pg 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-framed goats, with a greater skeletal size, reach mature weight at a later age (36 to 42 months) than small-framed goats (18 to 24 months) if both are fed to their full potential.  Large-framed goats need more calories than small-framed goats for maintenance of daily functions.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R.E. and Field, T.G., "Growth and Development" ''Scientific Farm Animal Production: An Introduction to Animal Science'', 6th Ed. Prentice-Hall (1999) Upper Saddle River pg 324-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Goats butting heads in Germany.jpg|thumb|Goats establish a [[dominance hierarchy]] in flocks, sometimes through head butting.]]
[[File:The goats behavior within a herd.webm|thumb|An example of the goats' social behavior within a flock.]]
[[File:Tongue of goat.jpg|thumb|Glycerinated goat tongue]]
Goats are naturally curious. They are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious places. This makes them the only [[ruminant]] to regularly climb trees. Due to their agility and inquisitiveness, they are notorious for escaping their pens by testing fences and enclosures, either intentionally or simply because they are used to climbing. If any of the fencing can be overcome, goats will almost inevitably escape. Due to their intelligence, once a goat has discovered a weakness in the fence, they will exploit it repeatedly, and other goats will observe and quickly learn the same method.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Goats explore anything new or unfamiliar in their surroundings, primarily with their [[prehensile]] upper lip and tongue, by nibbling at them, occasionally even eating them.

When handled as a group, goats tend to display less herding behavior than sheep.  When grazing undisturbed, they tend to spread across the field or range, rather than feed side-by-side as do sheep. When nursing young, goats will leave their kids separated ("lying out") rather than clumped, as do sheep. They will generally turn and face an intruder and bucks are more likely to charge or butt at humans than are [[Sheep|rams]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, M.E. ''Restraint and Handling of Wild and Domestic Animals'', 3rd Ed, Witley-Blackwell, 2008 pg 144&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by [[Queen Mary University of London|Queen Mary University]] reports that goats try to communicate with people in the same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses. Goats were first domesticated as livestock more than 10,000 years ago.  Research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered, but was then modified. Specifically, when presented with a box, the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside, but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed, the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them, before looking back toward the box.  This is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets, such as dogs. Researchers believe that better understanding of human-goat interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals' welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Diseases==
{{Main article|List of infectious sheep and goat diseases}}

While goats are generally considered hardy animals and in many situations receive little medical care, they are subject to a number of diseases. Among the conditions affecting goats are respiratory diseases including [[pneumonia]], foot rot, internal parasites, pregnancy toxosis and feed toxicity. Feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location. Certain foreign fruits and vegetables can be toxic to different breeds of goats.

Goats can become infected with various viral and bacterial diseases, such as [[foot-and-mouth disease]], [[caprine arthritis encephalitis]], [[caseous lymphadenitis]], pinkeye, mastitis, and [[pseudorabies]].  They can transmit a number of zoonotic diseases to people, such as [[tuberculosis]], [[brucellosis]], [[Q-fever]], and [[rabies]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.C. ''Goat Medicine'', Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1994 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life expectancy==

Life expectancy for goats is between fifteen and eighteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Biological Data|editor=William S. Spector|publisher=Saunders|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; An instance of a goat reaching the age of 24 has been reported.&lt;ref name=fiascofarm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fiascofarm.com/goats/age.htm|title=Teeth, Life Expectancy &amp; How to estimate a goat's age|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=30 May 2009|publisher=fiascofarm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors can reduce this average expectancy; problems during kidding can lower a doe's expected life span to ten or eleven, and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck's expected life span to eight to ten years.&lt;ref name=fiascofarm /&gt;

A goat is useful to humans when it is living and when it is dead, first as a renewable provider of [[milk]], [[manure]], and [[fiber]], and then as meat and hide.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, M. A., "Present status of the world goat populations and their productivity", Lohmann Information, Vol. 45 (2), Oct. 2010, Page 43, http://www.lohmann-information.com/content/l_i_45_artikel17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[charitable organization|charities]] provide goats to [[poverty|impoverished]] people in poor countries, because goats are easier and cheaper to manage than [[cattle]], and have multiple uses. In addition, goats are used for driving and [[pack goat|packing]] purposes.

[[File:Boerbok.jpg|thumb|The [[Boer goat]] – in this case a buck – is a widely kept meat breed.]]

The intestine of goats is used to make "[[catgut]]", which is still in use as a material for internal human [[surgical suture]]s and strings for [[String instrument|musical instruments]]. The horn of the goat, which signifies plenty and wellbeing (the [[cornucopia]]), is also used to make [[spoon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;anonymous; [http://www.mnh.si.edu/lookingbothways/data/objects/36.html Goat-Horn Spoon].&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Worldwide goat population statistics ===
According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the top producers of goat milk in 2008 were India (4 million metric tons), Bangladesh (2.16 million metric tons) and the Sudan (1.47 million metric tons).&lt;ref&gt;FAOSTAT 2008 http://faostat.fao.org/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Husbandry ===
[[File:Jamnapari goat.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Reared goat(Husbandry)]]
Husbandry, or animal care and use, varies by region and culture. The particular housing used for goats depends not only on the intended use of the goat, but also on the region of the world where they are raised. Historically, domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by [[goatherd]]s who were frequently children or [[adolescent]]s, similar to the more widely known [[shepherd]]. These methods of [[herding]] are still used today.

In some parts of the world, especially Europe and North America, distinct breeds of goats are kept for dairy (milk) and for meat production.  Excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat. Both does and bucks of meat breeds may be slaughtered for meat, as well as older animals of any breed.  The meat of older bucks (more than one year old) is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption. Castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor.
[[File:Asseta Lompo with her goats.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|For [[smallholder]] farmers in many countries, such as this woman from [[Burkina Faso]], goats are important livestock.]]

Dairy goats are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter.  As dairy does are milked daily, they are generally kept close to the milking shed. Their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrates. Stabled goats may be kept in stalls similar to horses, or in larger group pens.  In the US system, does are generally rebred annually.  In some European commercial dairy systems, the does are bred only twice, and are milked continuously for several years after the second kidding.

Meat goats are more frequently pastured year-round, and may be kept many miles from barns.  Angora and other fiber breeds are also kept on pasture or range. Range-kept and pastured goats may be supplemented with hay or concentrates, most frequently during the winter or dry seasons.

In the [[Indian subcontinent]] and much of Asia, goats are kept largely for milk production, both in commercial and household settings. The goats in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder. The Salem Black goat is herded to pasture in fields and along roads during the day, but is kept penned at night for safe-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Thiruvenkadan, A.K, Characterisation of Salem Black goats in their home tract, Animal Genetic Resources Information, No. 38, 2006 ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0540t/a0540t06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa and the Mideast, goats are typically run in flocks with sheep.  This maximizes the production per acre, as goats and sheep prefer different food plants. Multiple types of goat-raising are found in Ethiopia, where four main types have been identified: pastured in annual crop systems, in perennial crop systems, with cattle, and in arid areas, under pastoral (nomadic) herding systems. In all four systems, however, goats were typically kept in extensive systems, with few purchased inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Gizaw, S.; Tegegne, A.; Gebremedhin, B.; Hoekstra, D. 2010. Sheep and goat production and marketing systems in Ethiopia: characteristics and strategies for improvement. IPMS (Improving Productivity and Market Success) of Ethiopian Farmers Project Working Paper 23. 58p. Nairobi (Kenya): ILRI. http://hdl.handle.net/10568/2238&lt;/ref&gt; Household goats are traditionally kept in Nigeria.  While many goats are allowed to wander the homestead or village, others are kept penned and fed in what is called a 'cut-and-carry' system.  This type of husbandry is also used in parts of Latin America.  Cut-and-carry, which refers to the practice of cutting down grasses, corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field, is particularly suited for types of feed, such as corn or cane, that are easily destroyed by trampling.&lt;ref&gt;Sumberg, J.E., "Small ruminant feed production in a farming systems context" Proceedings of the Workshop on Small Ruminant Production Systems in the Humid Zone of West Africa, 1984; Sumber, J. E., ed, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Pet goats may be found in many parts of the world when a family keeps one or more animals for emotional reasons rather than as production animals.  It is becoming more common for goats to be kept exclusively as pets in North America and Europe.

=== Meat ===
{{Main article|Goat meat}}

The taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of [[lamb and mutton|spring lamb]] meat;&lt;ref name=LifeMag1945&gt;{{cite book|title=Milk Goats|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=goat%20tastes%20like%20lamb&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=goat%20tastes%20like%20lamb |date=Jun 18, 1945|publisher=Life |accessdate=2010-07-06|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, in the English-speaking islands of the [[Caribbean]], and in some parts of Asia, particularly [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]] and [[India]], the word “[[mutton]]” is used to describe both goat and lamb meat. However, some compare the taste of goat meat to [[veal]] or [[venison]], depending on the age and condition of the goat.  Its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of [[4-methyloctanoic acid|4-methyloctanoic]] and [[4-methylnonanoic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, D.A. (1983) ''Chemical compounds implicated in lamb flavor''. Food Technonogy. flavor.. 37:249-257 and Wong, E., Nixon, L.N. and Johnson, B.C. (1975) ''The contribution of 4-methyloctanoic (hircinoic) acid to mutton and goat meat flavor''. New Zealand j. Agr. Res. 18:261-266. Both cited in K. Intarapichet K., Sihaboot W. and Chungsiriwat P.

Due to its low fat content, the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional moisture. One of the most popular goats grown for meat is the [[South Africa]]n [[Boer goat|Boer]], introduced into the [[United States]] in the early 1990s.  The [[New Zealand]] [[Kiko goat|Kiko]] is also considered a meat breed, as is the [[Fainting goat|myotonic or "fainting goat"]], a breed originating in [[Tennessee]].














=== Milk, butter and cheese ===
{{see also|List of goat milk cheeses}}
[[File:Goat milking on an organic farm in Israel.jpg|thumb|A goat being machine milked on an [[organic farm]]]]
Goats produce about 2% of the world's total annual milk supply.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 1997. 1996 Production Yearbook. Food Agr. Organ., UN. Rome, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; Some goats are bred specifically for [[milk]].  If the strong-smelling buck is not separated from the does, his scent will affect the milk.

Goat milk naturally has small, well-emulsified fat globules, which means the cream remains suspended in the milk, instead of rising to the top, as in raw cow milk; therefore, it does not need to be [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenized]]. Indeed, if the milk is to be used to make cheese, homogenization is not recommended, as this changes the structure of the milk, affecting the culture's ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheese.&lt;ref&gt;Amrein-Boyes, D. (2009). 200 Easy Homemade Cheese Recipes. Robert Rose Inc.: Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

Dairy goats in their prime (generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle) average—{{convert|6|to|8|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}—of milk production daily—roughly {{convert|3|to|4|U.S.qt|l|abbr=on|order=flip}}—during a ten-month [[lactation]], producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation.  The milk generally averages 3.5% [[butterfat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adga.org/ American Dairy Goat Association], adga.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Goat milk is commonly processed into [[cheese]], [[butter]], [[ice cream]], [[yogurt]], ''[[cajeta]]'' and other products.  [[Goat's milk cheese|Goat cheese]] is known as ''fromage de chèvre'' ("goat cheese") in France. Some varieties include [[Rocamadour (cheese)|Rocamadour]] and Montrachet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.foodnetwork.com/food/web/encyclopedia/termdetail/0,7770,1237,00.html Chèvre cheese], foodnetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Goat [[butter]] is white because goats produce milk with the yellow [[beta-carotene]] converted to a colorless form of [[vitamin A]].

==== Nutrition ====
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] discourages feeding infants milk derived from goats. An April 2010 case report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fresh Goat's Milk for Infants: Myths and Realities—A Review|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/125/4/e973|publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes their recommendation and presents "a comprehensive review of the consequences associated with this dangerous practice", also stating, "Many infants are exclusively fed unmodified goat's milk as a result of cultural beliefs as well as exposure to false online information. Anecdotal reports have described a host of morbidities associated with that practice, including severe electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylactic shock, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and infections." Untreated caprine [[brucellosis]] results in a 2% case fatality rate. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], doe milk is not recommended for human infants because it contains "inadequate quantities of [[iron]], [[folate]], [[vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[vitamin D|D]], [[thiamine]], [[niacin]], [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[pantothenic acid]] to meet an infant’s nutritional needs" and may cause harm to an infant's [[kidneys]] and could cause metabolic damage.&lt;ref name="USDA 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Infant Formula Feeding|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Topics/FG/Chapter4_InfantFormulaFeeding.pdf|publisher=[[USDA]]|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some farming groups promote the practice.

=== Fiber ===
[[File:Angora 001.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Angora goat]]]]
The Angora breed of goats produces long, curling, lustrous locks of [[mohair]]. The entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow to four inches or more in length.  Angora crossbreeds, such as the [[Pygora Goat|pygora]] and the [[Nigora goat|nigora]], have been created to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller, easier-to-manage animal.
The wool is [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] twice a year, with an average yield of about {{convert|10|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

Most goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer [[guard hairs]] on the surface.  The desirable fiber for the [[textile industry]] is the former, and it goes by several names (down, cashmere and pashmina).  The coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye. The [[cashmere goat]] produces a commercial quantity of [[cashmere wool]], which is one of the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced; cashmere is very fine and soft. The cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year, yielding around {{convert|9|oz|g|abbr=on|order=flip}} of down.

In [[South Asia]], cashmere is called "[[pashmina]]" (from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''pashmina'', "fine wool").
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Kashmir (then called Cashmere by the British), had a thriving industry producing shawls from goat-hair imported from Tibet and Tartary through Ladakh.  The shawls were introduced into Western Europe when the General in Chief of the French campaign in Egypt (1799–1802) sent one to Paris. Since these shawls were produced in the upper [[Kashmir]] and [[Ladakh]] region, the wool came to be known as "cashmere".

=== Land clearing ===
Goats have been used by humans to clear unwanted vegetation for centuries. They have been described as "eating machines" and "biological control agents".&lt;ref name="seattlepi2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Rent-a-goats-gain-foothold-1240623.php|title=Rent-a-goats gain foothold|work=seattlepi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/meatgoat/MGLand.htm|title=NCSU: Animal Science – Meat Goats in Land and Forage Management|work=ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a resurgence of this in North America since 1990, when herds were used to clear dry brush from California hillsides thought to be endangered by potential wildfires. This form of using goats to clear land is sometimes known as [[conservation grazing]].  Since then, numerous public and private agencies have hired private herds to perform similar tasks.&lt;ref name="seattlepi2007" /&gt;  This practice has become popular in the [[Pacific Northwest]], where they are used to remove invasive species not easily removed by humans, including (thorned) blackberry vines and [[poison oak]].&lt;ref name="seattlepi2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/465/465-341/465-341.html|title=Options for Clearing Land: Pasture Establishment for Horses – Publications and Educational Resources - Virginia Tech|date=1 May 2009|work=vt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30583512 The goats fighting America's plant invasion] (January 2015), ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use for medical training ===
As a goat's anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of human, some countries' militaries use goats to train [[combat medic]]s. In the United States, goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== As pets ==
{{main article|Goats as pets}}
Some people choose goats as a pet because of their ability to form close bonds with their human guardians. Because of goats' herd mentality, they will follow their owners around and form close bonds with them.

== Breeds ==
{{Main article|List of goat breeds}}
Goat breeds fall into overlapping, general categories. They are generally distributed in those used for dairy, fiber, meat, skins, and as companion animals. Some breeds are also particularly noted as [[pack goat]]s.

== Showing ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
[[File:NigerianDwarfDairyGoat.jpg|thumb|A [[Nigerian Dwarf]] milker in show clip. This doe is angular and dairy with a capacious and well supported mammary system.]]
Goat [[breeder]]s' clubs frequently hold [[show (animal)|shows]], where goats are judged on traits relating to [[Equine conformation|conformation]], [[udder]] quality, evidence of high production, longevity, build and muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production and the fiber itself (fiber goats). People who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award-winning animals command a higher price. Registered goats, in general, are usually higher-priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. A registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder.
Children's clubs such as [[4-H]] also allow goats to be shown. Children's shows often include a showmanship class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are scored. In a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged.

Various "Dairy Goat Scorecards" (milking does) are systems used for judging shows in the US.   The [[American Dairy Goat Association]] (ADGA) scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major categories that include general appearance, the dairy character of a doe (physical traits that aid and increase milk production), body capacity, and specifically for the mammary system. Young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character.

The American Goat Society (AGS) has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows. The miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards. The "Angora Goat scorecard" used by the Colored Angora Goat Breeder's Association (CAGBA), which covers the white and the colored goats, includes evaluation of an animal's fleece color, density, uniformity, fineness, and general body confirmation. Disqualifications include: a deformed mouth, broken down [[pastern]]s, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3&amp;nbsp;inch split in scrotum, and close-set or distorted horns.

== Religion, mythology and folklore ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}
[[File:Oinochoe Wild Goat Louvre A311.jpg|thumb|An ancient Greek ''[[oenochoe]]'' depicting wild goats]]
Archaeologists excavating the ancient city of [[Ebla]] in [[Syria]] discovered, among others, the tomb of some king or great noble which included 
a throne decorated with bronze goat heads. That led to this tomb becoming known as "The Tomb of the Lord of the Goats".&lt;ref&gt;"The Eighteenth Century BC Princes of Byblos and Ebla and the Chronology of the Middle Bronze Age", p. 161 ([https://www.academia.edu/1096021/The_Eighteenth_Century_BC_Princes_of_Byblos_and_Ebla_and_the_Chronology_of_the_Middle_Bronze_Age 161])&lt;/ref&gt;
{{sfn|Matthiae|2010|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=noPMQgAACAAJ&amp;dq 217]}}

According to [[Norse mythology]], the god of thunder, [[Thor]], has a [[chariot]] that is pulled by the goats [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr]].&lt;ref name=symbols&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=J.C.|title=An illustrated encyclopaedia of traditional symbols|date=1979|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-500-27125-4|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; At night when he sets up camp, Thor eats the meat of the goats, but takes care that all bones remain whole. Then he wraps the remains up, and in the morning, the goats always come back to life to pull the chariot. When a farmer's son who is invited to share the meal breaks one of the goats' leg bones to suck the marrow, the animal's leg remains broken in the morning, and the boy is forced to serve Thor as a servant to compensate for the damage.

Possibly related, the [[Yule Goat]] is one of the oldest [[Scandinavia]]n and Northern [[Europe]]an [[Yule]] and [[Christmas]] symbols and traditions. Yule Goat originally denoted the goat that was slaughtered around Yule, but it may also indicate a goat figure made out of straw. It is also used about the custom of going door-to-door singing carols and getting food and drinks in return, often fruit, cakes and sweets. "Going Yule Goat" is similar to the British custom [[wassailing]], both with {{linktext|heathen}} roots. The [[Gävle Goat]] is a giant version of the Yule Goat, erected every year in the Swedish city of [[Gävle]].

The Greek god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] is said to have the upper body of a man and the horns and lower body of a goat.&lt;ref name=symbols /&gt; Pan was a very lustful god, nearly all of the myths involving him had to do with him chasing nymphs. He is also credited with creating the [[pan flute]].

The goat is one of the twelve-year cycle of animals which appear in the [[Chinese zodiac]] related to the [[Chinese calendar]]. Each animal is associated with certain personality traits; those born in a year of the [[Goat (zodiac)|goat]] are predicted to be shy, introverted, creative, and perfectionist.
[[File:Amalthea Julien Louvre CC230.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Amalthée et la chèvre de Jupiter'' ([[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] and Jupiter's goat); commissioned by the [[Marie Antoinette|Queen of France]] in 1787 for the royal dairy at [[Rambouillet]]]]
Several mythological hybrid creatures are believed to consist of parts of the goat, including the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]. The [[Capricornus|Capricorn]] sign in the Western [[zodiac]] is usually depicted as a goat with a [[fish]]'s tail. [[Faun]]s and [[satyr]]s are mythological creatures that are part goat and part human. The mineral [[bromine]] is named from the Greek word "brόmos", which means "stench of he-goats".

Goats are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]]. A goat is considered a "clean" animal by [[Kosher|Jewish dietary laws]] and was slaughtered for an honored guest. It was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices. Goat-hair curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:4). Its horns can be used instead of sheep's horn to make a [[shofar]].&lt;ref name="Hearing Shofar"&gt;Chusid, Michael T. [http://hearingshofar.com/book.htm ''Hearing Shofar: The Still Small Voice of the Ram's Horn''], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Yom Kippur]], the festival of the Day of Atonement, two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them. One was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness, symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community. From this comes the word "[[scapegoat]]". A leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] told a [[parable]] of [[the Sheep and the Goats]] ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 25).

Popular [[Christianity in Europe|Christian]] folk tradition in [[Europe]] associated [[Satan]] with imagery of goats.&lt;ref name=symbols /&gt; A common [[superstition]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was that goats whispered lewd sentences in the ears of the [[saint]]s. The origin of this belief was probably the behavior of the buck in [[estrus cycle|rut]], the very epitome of lust. The common medieval depiction of the [[Devil]] was that of a goat-like face with horns and small beard (a [[goatee]]). The [[Black Mass]], a probably mythological "Satanic mass", involved Satan manifesting as a black goat for worship.

The goat has had a lingering connection with [[Satanism]] and [[paganism|pagan]] [[religion]]s, even into modern times. The inverted [[pentagram]], a symbol used in Satanism, is said to be shaped like a goat's head. The "[[Baphomet]] of [[Mendes]]" refers to a satanic goat-like figure from 19th-century [[occult]]ism.

The common  Russian surname ''[[Kozlov]]'' ({{lang-ru|Козло́в}}), means "goat". [[Goatee]] refers to a style of [[facial hair]] incorporating hair on a man’s [[chin]], so named because of some similarity to a goat's facial feature.

== Feral goats ==
{{Main article|Feral goat}}
[[File:Feral goat in Aruba.JPG|thumb|Feral goat in [[Aruba]]]]
Goats readily revert to the wild (become feral) if given the opportunity. The only domestic animal known to return to feral life as swiftly is the cat.&lt;ref name=OKstate /&gt;  Feral goats have established themselves in many areas: they occur in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Galapagos]] and in many other places.  When feral goats reach large populations in habitats which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predators or which are otherwise vulnerable to goats' aggressive grazing habits, they may have serious effects, such as removing native [[scrubland|scrub]], [[tree]]s and other vegetation which is required by a wide range of other creatures, not just other grazing or browsing animals. Feral goats are common in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;It is believed that there are over 50,000 feral goats in the Australian Outback. [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/goat/pubs/goat.pdf "The feral goat (''Capra hircus'') – Invasive species fact sheet".], environment.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other circumstances where predator pressure is maintained, they may be accommodated into some balance in the local food web.

'''Domestic sheep''' (''Ovis aries'') are [[quadruped]]al, [[ruminant]] [[mammal]]s typically kept as [[livestock]]. Like most ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the [[even-toed ungulate]]s. Although the name '''sheep''' applies to many species in the genus ''[[Ovis]]'', in everyday usage it almost always refers to ''Ovis aries''. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ''ewe'' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː}}), an intact male as a ''ram'' or occasionally a ''tup'', a [[Castration|castrated]] male as a ''wether'', and a younger sheep as a  ''lamb''.

Sheep are most likely descended from the wild [[mouflon]] of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for [[agriculture|agricultural]] purposes, sheep are raised for [[wool|fleece]], meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and [[sheep milk|milk]]. A sheep's [[wool]] is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by [[sheep shearing|shearing]]. [[Wikt:ovine|Ovine]] meat is called [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] when from younger animals and [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults).  Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for [[Sheepskin (material)|pelts]], as [[dairy]] animals, or as [[model organism]]s for science.

[[Sheep husbandry]] is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the southern and central [[South America]]n nations, and the [[British Isles]] are most closely associated with sheep production.

Sheepraising has a large [[glossary of sheep husbandry|lexicon of unique terms]] which vary considerably by region and [[dialect]]. Use of the word ''sheep'' began in [[Middle English]] as a derivation of the [[Old English]] word ''{{lang|ang|scēap}}''; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, [[herd]] or mob. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.

Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and [[symbology]]. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with [[pastoral]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] imagery. Sheep figure in many [[mythology|mythologies]]—such as the [[Golden Fleece]]—and major religions, especially the [[Abrahamic]] traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as [[animal sacrifice|sacrificial animals]].

Sheep husbandry spread quickly in  Europe. Excavations show that in about 6000 BC, during the [[Neolithic]] period of prehistory, the Castelnovien people, living around [[Châteauneuf-les-Martigues]] near present-day [[Marseille]] in the south of France, were among the first in Europe to keep domestic sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Max Escalon de Fonton, ''L'Homme avant l'histoire'', p. 16–17, in ''Histoire de la Provence'', Editions Privat, Toulouse, 1990. See also F. Bourdier, ''Préhistoire de France'' (Paris, 1967) and G. Bailloud, ''Les civilisations Néolithiques de la France'' (Paris, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Practically from its inception, [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilization]] relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;{{rp|13}} [[Ancient Romans]] kept sheep on a wide scale, and were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] (''Naturalis Historia''), speaks at length about sheep and wool.&lt;ref name="pliny"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Pliny the Elder]] | title= Naturalis Historia | year=1855| orig-year= 77 | pages=  Chapters 72–75 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137 | accessdate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; European colonists spread the practice to the [[New World]] from 1493 onwards.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Characteristics==
Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a [[Crimp (wool)|crimped]] hair called wool and often with horns forming a [[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] [[spiral]]. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely [[Neoteny|neotenic]] as a result of selective breeding by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Budianksy, pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. [[Polled livestock|polled]]), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat"/&gt;

Another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or [[piebald]].&lt;ref name="rmcsba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcsba"/&gt; Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a [[dominant trait]] it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a [[recessive]] trait in white flocks.&lt;ref name="rmcsba"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmncsba.org/ |title=Natural Colored Sheep |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Natural Colored Sheep Breeders Association |date=January 2007 |work=Rare Breeds Watchlist }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bcsba"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsba.org.uk/coloured-sheep/coloured-sheep.html |title=An introduction to coloured sheep |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=British Coloured Sheep Breeders Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110215254/http://www.bcsba.org.uk/coloured-sheep/coloured-sheep.html |archivedate=2007-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a [[niche market]] for colored fleeces, mostly for [[handspinning]].&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so [[wool classing]] is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.[[File:Take ours!.jpg|thumb|left|[[Suffolk sheep|Suffolks]] are a medium wool, black-faced breed of meat sheep that make up 60% of the sheep population in the U.S.&lt;ref name="storey" /&gt;]]Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a [[heritable]] trait that is often selected for in breeding.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; Ewes typically weigh between {{Convert|45|and|100|kg|lb|-1}}, and rams between {{Convert|45|and|160|kg|lb|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |author=Melinda J.

D. and T. L. Spurgeon. 1992. Anatomy and physiology of farm animals. 5th ed. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt; Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight [[incisor]]s, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped [[Canine tooth|canines]]. This means that the [[Dentition|dental formula]] for sheep is either {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.3.3|lower=4.0.3.3}} or {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.3.3|lower=3.1.3.3}} &lt;!-- I:0/4 C:0/0 P:3/3 M:3/3, or I:0/3 C:0/1 P:3/3 M:3/3 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/pregastric/cowpage.html |title=Dental Anatomy of Ruminants from Colorado State University |publisher=Vivo.colostate.edu |date=2001-11-07 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large [[diastema (dentistry)|diastema]] between the [[incisor]]s and the [[molars]].

In the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of [[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]] is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age. The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal. For this reason, domestic sheep on normal [[pasture]] begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Schoenian | first =Susan | title =Sheep Basics | work =Sheep101.info | url =http://www.sheep101.info/sheepbasics.html | accessdate =2007-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="begin" /&gt; [[File:Crâne mouton.jpg|thumb|Skull]]Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled.&lt;ref name=smith5&gt;Smith et al., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent [[peripheral vision]]; with visual fields of about 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads.&lt;ref name="hobby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASI"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shulaw |first=Dr. William P.|year=2006 |title=Sheep Care Guide |url=http://www.sheepusa.org/index.phtml?page=site/get_file&amp;print=1&amp;file_id=9a0f14975be048606228762fc2d2a7ff |publisher=American Sheep Industry Association|accessdate= 2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds.

In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas,&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; and prefer to move uphill when disturbed. Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet. The purpose of these glands is uncertain,&lt;ref name="Smith4"/&gt; but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; The foot glands might also be related to reproduction,&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; but alternative reasons, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.&lt;ref name="Smith4"&gt;Smith et al., p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison with goats ===
Sheep and [[goat]]s are closely related: both are in the subfamily [[Caprinae]]. However, they are separate species, so [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a [[sheep-goat hybrid]] (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and is not to be confused with the [[sheep-goat chimera]], though both are known as ''geep''. Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or [[Docking (animal)|docked]], while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally [[Polled livestock|polled]] (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], whereas rams do not.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt;

In: Piper, L.  and A. Ruvinsky (eds.). The genetics of sheep. CABI&lt;/ref&gt; 1314 breeds as of 1995&lt;ref&gt;Scherf, B. D. 2000. World watch list for domestic animal diversity. 3rd Edition. FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt;  and 1229 breeds as of 2006.&lt;ref name="FAO 2007"&gt;FAO. 2007. State of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture&lt;/ref&gt; (These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is "either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity."&lt;ref name="FAO 2007"/&gt; Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed. Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the [[topography]] for which the breed has been developed. This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Shepherd |last=Brown |first=Dave |author2=Sam Meadowcroft  |year=1996 |publisher=Farming Press |location=Wharfedale Road, Ipswich 1P1 4LG, United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-85236-188-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sheep may also be of a [[fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed type]], which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.

[[File:Barbados Blackbelly.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Barbados Blackbelly]] is a hair sheep breed of [[Caribbean]] origin.]]
Breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from [[Merino (sheep)|Merino]] sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces.&lt;ref name="D’Arcy"&gt;D’Arcy, J.B., Sheep Management &amp; Wool Technology, NSW University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-86840-106-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some major medium wool breeds, such as the [[Corriedale sheep|Corriedale]], are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]] breed was developed by crossing [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln]] rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled [[Rambouillet (sheep)|Rambouillet]] ewes.

Coarse or [[carpet]] wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.&lt;ref name="living"&gt;Wooster&lt;/ref&gt;

A minor class of sheep are the [[dairy]] breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dairy Sheep Nutrition |last=Pulina |first=Giuseppe |author2=Roberta Bencini  |year=2004 |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=978-0-85199-595-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rTdfR3UxWXQC&amp;dq=dairy+sheep+breeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.&lt;ref name="Pulina2"&gt;Pulina et al. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lička pramenka.jpg|thumb|The [[Lička pramenka]] is a sheep breed of [[Croatia]]n origin]]

A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or '''hair sheep''', which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the [[Dorper (sheep)|Dorper]], result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; Hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt;

With the modern rise of corporate [[agribusiness]] and the decline of localized [[family farm]]s, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction. The [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] of the UK lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals (each), and [[The Livestock Conservancy]] lists 14 as either "critical" or "threatened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/sheep.php |title=Sheep |accessdate=2008-09-07 |author=[[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] (UK) |date=January 2008 |work=Rare Breeds Watchlist | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622235527/http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/sheep.php| archivedate = June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/main.php|title=Watchlist |accessdate=2008-09-07 |author=[[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] (UK) | year=2008 |work=A numerical guide to the 2008 Watchlist categories  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080731020600/http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/main.php| archivedate = July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/conservation-priority-list#Sheep|title = Conservation Priority List|publisher = [[The Livestock Conservancy]]|accessdate = 2013-09-03|work = livestockconservancy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; Those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.

==Diet==
Sheep are exclusively [[herbivorous]] mammals. Most breeds prefer to graze on [[grass]] and other short [[roughage]], avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume.&lt;ref name="Pugh, pp. 19"&gt;Pugh, pp. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sheep and goats use their [[lip]]s and [[tongue]]s to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition.&lt;ref name="Pugh, pp. 19"/&gt; Sheep, however, graze well in [[monoculture]] pastures where most goats fare poorly.&lt;ref name="Pugh, pp. 19"/&gt; 
[[File:Rumen-sheep2.jpg|thumb|Ruminant system of a sheep]]
Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex [[digestive system]] composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down [[cellulose]] from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler [[carbohydrate]]s. When sheep [[Grazing|graze]], vegetation is chewed into a mass called a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]], which is then passed into the [[rumen]], via the [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]]. The rumen is a 19- to 38-liter (5 to 10 gallon) organ in which feed is [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]].&lt;ref name="simmons146"&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; The fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;Van Soest, P. J. 1994.  Nutritional ecology of the ruminant.  2nd ed.  Cornell Univ. Press.  476 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  (Other important rumen organisms include some archaea, which produce methane from carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = A.-D. G. | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Molecular diversity of rumen methanogens from sheep in Western Australia | url = | journal = Appl. Environ. Microbiol. | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 1263–1270 | doi=10.1128/aem.70.3.1263-1270.2004| pmid = 15006742 | pmc = 368393}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as [[cud]] for additional chewing and [[salivation]].&lt;ref name="simmons146" /&gt; After fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]] and the [[omasum]]; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether. After the first three chambers, food moves into the [[abomasum]] for final digestion before processing by the [[intestine]]s. The abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the "true stomach".&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is [[hay]], often during the winter months. The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet.&lt;ref name="living" /&gt; Also included in some sheep's diets are [[mineral]]s, either in a trace mix or in [[Salt lick|licks]]. Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of [[copper]] that are lethal to sheep.&lt;ref name="hobby" /&gt; The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as [[salt lick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grazing behavior===
Sheep follow a [[diurnality|diurnal]] pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their [[cud]]. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of [[grass]]es, [[legume]]s and [[forb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, [[Taxus|yew]], rhubarb, potato, and [[rhododendron]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SnakeValley.JPG|thumb|right|Sheep grazing on public land ([[Utah]], 2009)]]

====Effects on pasture====
Sheep are largely [[grazing]] herbivores, unlike [[Browsing (predation)|browsing]] animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can [[overgraze]] a pasture much faster than cattle.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt; For this reason, many shepherds use [[managed intensive rotational grazing]], where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of [[invasive species|invasive plant species]]. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as [[cheatgrass]], [[Euphorbia virgata|leafy spurge]], [[kudzu]] and [[spotted knapweed]] over native species such as [[sagebrush]], making grazing sheep effective for [[conservation grazing]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in [[Imperial County, California]] compared lamb grazing with [[herbicides]] for [[weed]] control in seedling [[alfalfa]] fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. [[Entomologist]]s also compared grazing lambs to [[insecticides]] for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ucanr.org/delivers/impactview.cfm?impactnum=176 |title=Sheep grazing reduces pesticide use in alfalfa |work=ucanr.org |publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Border Collie sheepdog trial.jpg|thumb|Sheep showing flocking behavior during a [[sheepdog trial]]]]
[[File:Flock of sheep in South Africa (2015).jpg|thumb|Flock of sheep in [[South Africa]] (2015)]]

===Flock behavior===
Sheep are [[Herd animal|flock]] animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies. The [[dominance hierarchy]] of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species.&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;Budiansky&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in contrast to the [[red deer]] and [[gazelle]] (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend [[Territory (animal)|territories]] although they do form [[home ranges]].&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987).  A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge  pp.55&lt;/ref&gt;  All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed,&lt;ref name=smith5/&gt; and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; During flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow and a leader may simply be the first individual to move.  Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;  Sheep can become [[hefted]] to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes. Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1634526.stm| publisher=BBC News| date=2001-11-03| title=Sheep taught to stay put| accessdate=2006-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their [[flight zone]] is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;

In regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.&lt;ref name="begin"/&gt;

====Herding====
[[File:Round 'em up.jpg|thumb|right|Escaped sheep being led back to pasture with the enticement of food. This method of moving sheep works best with smaller flocks.]]
Farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as [[hill farming]], and to move them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use [[herding dog]]s in this effort, with a highly bred [[herding]] ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food.&lt;ref&gt;Budiasnky p. 100 et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, pp. 73, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominance hierarchy===
Sheep establish a [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness. Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at [[wikt:trough|troughs]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Budiansky78"&gt;Budiansky p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so.&lt;ref name="Budiansky78"/&gt;  [[Merino]]s have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Squires | first1 = V.R. | last2 = Daws | first2 = G.T. | year = 1975 | title = Leadership and dominance relationships in Merino and Border Leicester sheep | url = | journal = Applied Animal Ethology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 263–274 | doi=10.1016/0304-3762(75)90019-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)" /&gt;

===Intelligence and learning ability===
Sheep are frequently thought of as [[Animal cognition|unintelligent animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al., p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Their  flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated. Despite these perceptions, a [[University of Illinois system|University of Illinois]] [[monograph]] on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs, and on par with that of cattle.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;
Sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces, and remember them for years.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kendrick |first=Keith |author2=da Costa AP |author3=Leigh AE |author4=Hinton MR |author5=Peirce JW  |date=November 2001 |title=Sheep don't forget a face |journal=Nature |volume= 414|issue= 6860|pages= 165–6|id=11700543 |doi=10.1038/35102669 |pmid=11700543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minds"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=March 2008|title=Animal Minds|periodical=[[National Geographic Magazine]]|publisher=The [[National Geographic Society]]|volume=213|issue=3}} pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;&lt;ref name="minds"/&gt; If worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names and many sheep are trained to be led by [[halter]] for showing and other purposes.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; Sheep have also responded well to [[clicker training]].&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; Sheep have been used as pack animals; [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;

It has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] allegedly found a way to get over [[cattle grid]]s by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/30/sillyseason.ruralaffairs|title=Pennine spot where sheep won't be fenced in|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|date=2004-07-30|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocalisations===
{{listen |filename=Sheep bleating.ogg |title=A sheep baa |description=A sheep bleat}}
Sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts.   Bleating ("baaing") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, but also at times between other flock members.&lt;ref name=Lynch1992&gt;Lynch, J.J., G. N Hinch and D. B. Adams.  (1992).  ''The Behaviour Of Sheep:  Biological Principles And Implications For Production.''  CABI, Wallingford.  237 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  The bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, A. F. and D. M. Broom.  (1997).  ''Farm Animal Behaviour And Welfare.'' 3rd Ed. CABI, Wallingford, UK.  437 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition.&lt;ref name=Lynch1992/&gt;  A variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances. Apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain.  Isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep.&lt;ref name=Dwyer2008b&gt;Dwyer, C.M. (ed.)  (2008).  ''The Welfare Of Sheep.''  CABI, Wallingford, UK.  366 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor.&lt;ref&gt;Vince, M. A., A. E. Billing, B. A. Baldwin, J. N. Toner and C. Weller.  (1985).

In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide. In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, averaging 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°.&lt;ref name=Piggins1996&gt;Piggins, D. and C. J. C. Phillips. 1996. The eye of the domesticated sheep and its implications for vision. Animal Science. 62: 301–308.&lt;/ref&gt; In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause "wool blindness". In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool,&lt;ref name=Hutson1980&gt;Hutson, G. D. 1980. Visual field, restricted vision and sheep movement in laneways. Appl. Anim. Ethol. 6: 175–187.&lt;/ref&gt; although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing. In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns,&lt;ref name=Hutson1980/&gt; so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head. Sheep eyes exhibit very low [[hyperopia]] and little [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]. Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance.&lt;ref name=Piggins1996/&gt; Because sheep eyes have no [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation]], one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image could be provided by the [[Tapetum lucidum|tapetum]] and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length.&lt;ref name=Piggins1996/&gt; Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in "visual cliff" experiments;&lt;ref name=Hutson1980/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, A.

Taste is the most important sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected. Touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.&lt;ref name="Krueger, et al., (1974)"&gt;Krueger, W.C., Laycock, W.A. and Price, D.A., (1974).

The ram uses his [[vomeronasal]] organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) to sense the pheromones of ewes and detect when they are in [[estrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ungerfeld | first1 = R. | last2 = Ramos | first2 = M.

==Reproduction==
{{Main|Domestic sheep reproduction}}
[[File:Emerging lamb cropped.jpg|thumb|The second of twins being born.]]
Sheep follow a similar [[Reproduction|reproductive]] strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in [[feral]] populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; Most sheep are [[seasonal breeder]]s, although some are able to breed year-round.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;Jainudeen, M. R. et al.  2000, "Sheep and goats". In: Hafez, E. S. E. and B. Hafez (eds.) Reproduction in farm animals. 7th ed. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins. pp. 172–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Ewes have [[estrus]] cycles about every 17 days,&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for [[Homosexual behavior in animals|homosexuality]]&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus ''in utero'' are [[freemartin]]s (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning [[Ovary|ovaries]]).&lt;ref name="freemartin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Padula |first=A.M. |year=2005 |title=The freemartin syndrome: an update. |journal=Animal Reproduction Science |volume=87 |issue=1/2 |pages=93–109 |url=http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/anirep/article/S0378-4320(04)00231-3/abstract |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102120147/http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/anirep/article/S0378-4320(04)00231-3/abstract |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-02 |doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2004.09.008 |pmid=15885443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, T.

In feral sheep, rams may fight during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;

After mating, sheep have a [[gestation]] period of about five months,&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; and normal labor takes one to three hours.&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quints"&gt;{{cite news |title=Quintuplet birth takes sheep breeder by surprise |url=http://www.praguemonitor.com/en/258/czech_business/17581/ |work=Prague Daily Monitor |publisher=Czech News Agency |date= 2008-01-24 |accessdate=2008-01-25 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080129030117/http://www.praguemonitor.com/en/258/czech_business/17581/| archivedate = January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|lambing jugs]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, et al., p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="living"/&gt;

[[File:Lamb first steps (edited).jpg|thumb|right|A lamb's first steps]]

Ovine [[obstetrics]] can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky, pp. 122–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; After the birth, ewes ideally break the [[amniotic sac]] (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital [[colostrum]] milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al., p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

After lambs are several weeks old, [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|lamb marking]] ([[Glossary of sheep husbandry|ear tagging]], [[Docking (animal)|docking]], and [[castrating]]) is carried out.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications.&lt;ref&gt;MAFF (UK) 2000.

==Health==
[[File:Scrapie testing.jpg|thumb|upright|A veterinarian draws blood to test for resistance to scrapie]]
Sheep may fall victim to poisons, [[List of infectious sheep and goat diseases|infectious diseases]], and physical injuries. As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless.&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use.&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al., p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions.  In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=530&amp;show |title=CFR – Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |date=1996-11-07 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as [[homeopathy]], [[herbalism]] and even [[traditional Chinese medicine]] to treat sheep veterinary problems.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; Despite some favorable [[anecdotal evidence]], the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in [[scientific journal]]s.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Paolo Bellavite |author2=Riccardo Ortolani |author3=Anita Conforti  |last-author-amp=yes |date=June 2006 |title=Immunology and Homeopathy.

Many breeders take a variety of [[Preventive medicine|preventive measures]] to ward off problems. The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and [[Quarantine|quarantining]] new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, T.

Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria.&lt;ref name="Gregory, N. G 1998"/&gt;  Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management.   Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are [[pesticide]] sprays, inorganic [[fertilizer]], [[motor oil]], as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sheep with orf.jpg|thumb|right|A sheep infected with [[Orf (disease)|orf]], a disease transmittable to humans through skin contact]]

Common forms of preventive medication for sheep are [[vaccination]]s and treatments for [[parasites]]. Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; [[Worm]]s are the most common internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as [[Deworming|drenches]], are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt;  External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep [[Hippoboscidae|keds]], [[nose bot]]s, [[Psorergates ovis|sheep itch mites]], and [[maggot]]s. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the [[bot fly]] and the [[blow-fly]]. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of [[flystrike]]. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, [[crutching]] (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow [[mulesing]], a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb.&lt;ref name = "DPI SOP"&gt;{{cite web

Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliners]], sprays or immersive [[sheep dip]]s.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;

A wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as [[foot rot]] and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine [[Johne's disease]] is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. [[Bluetongue disease]] is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the [[mucous membrane]]s. [[Ovine rinderpest]] (or ''peste des petits ruminants'') is a highly contagious and often fatal [[virus|viral]] disease affecting sheep and goats. Sheep may also be affected by primary &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jane C.

A few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans. [[Orf (animal disease)|Orf]] (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous [[anthrax]] is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic [[abortion]] in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the [[prion]] disease [[scrapie]] and the [[virus]] that causes [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;

===Predators===
{{Main|Domestic sheep predation}}
[[File:Coyotekilling.jpg|thumb|A lamb being attacked by [[coyote]]s with a bite to the throat]]
Other than parasites and disease, [[predation]] is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation.&lt;ref name="nass"/&gt; In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; Worldwide, [[Canidae|canids]]—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sheep mauled by wild dogs |url=http://www.tweeddailynews.com.au/news/apn-sheep-mauled-by-wild/145009/ |work=Tweed Daily News |date= 2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gareth |last=Lewis  |title=Sheep worrying leads to warning from farmers |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/debusiness/news/display.var.1980009.0.sheep_worrying_leads_to_warning_from_farmers.php |work=The Daily Echo |date= 2008-01-21 |accessdate=2008-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canids"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids |last=Macdonald |first=David Whyte |author2=Claudio Sillero-Zubiri  |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-851555-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and [[Razorback|feral hogs]].&lt;ref name="nass"&gt;{{cite web| date= 2005-05-06 |title=Sheep and Goats Death Loss | publisher=[[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] |url=http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1628 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, [[livestock guardian dog]]s, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and [[Electric fence|electric]]), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; More modern shepherds used guns, [[Animal trapping|traps]], and poisons to kill predators,&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/downloads/effects_on_predators.pdf |title=Effects of Wildlife Services on Predator Populations |date=October 2001 |publisher=Wildlife Services |accessdate=2016-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; Donkeys and [[guard llama]]s have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep.&lt;ref name="living"/&gt; In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;

Sheep are an important part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt; [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Australia]], [[India]], and [[Iran]] have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton.&lt;ref name="NQR"&gt;{{cite news |first=Marius |last=Cuming |title=Live sheep ship-shape |url=http://nqr.farmonline.com.au/news/nationalrural/livestock/sheep/live-sheep-shipshape/64508.aspx |work=North Queensland Register |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2008-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316093028/http://nqr.farmonline.com.au/news/nationalrural/livestock/sheep/live-sheep-shipshape/64508.aspx |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[Locavore|local food]] customers.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Severson |title=Iceland Woos America With Lamb and Skyr |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/dining/14icel.html?scp=2&amp;sq=sheep+overgrazing&amp;st=nyt |work=The New York Times |date=2005-09-14 |accessdate=2008-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in [[developing country|developing countries]], such flocks may be a part of [[subsistence agriculture]] rather than a system of trade.

Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials. Wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for [[synthetic fabric]]s.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without [[farm subsidies]].&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as [[wool insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wooster, p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.&lt;ref name="modern"/&gt;

[[Sheepskin]] is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value: sheep [[tallow]] can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and [[cartilage]] has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and [[gelatin]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarus p. 325–329&lt;/ref&gt; Sheep [[intestine]] can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into [[surgical suture]]s, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat"/&gt; Sheep droppings, which are high in [[cellulose]], have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional [[Wood pulp|pulp]] materials to make paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sheeppoopaper.com/how_made.asp |title=Sheep Poo paper | publisher= Creative Paper Wales |accessdate=2007-12-01 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012175558/http://sheeppoopaper.com/how_made.asp| archivedate = October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is [[lanolin]]: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable [[cosmetics]] and other products.&lt;ref name="sheep and goat"/&gt;

Some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep. Providing lambs for youth programs such as [[4-H]] and competition at [[agricultural show]]s is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered [[purebred]] animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; A new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these "[[Lawn mower|mowing]] services" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen [[fire hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius p. 332–334&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock. They do not require expensive housing,&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al., p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; such as that used in the [[intensive farming]] of chickens or pigs. They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joanna |last=Small |title=Sheep Compete With Beef |url=http://www.kspr.com/news/local/13906762.html |work=KSBR News |publisher=ABC |date= 2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-27 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316143253/http://www.kspr.com/news/local/13906762.html| archivedate = March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn.&lt;ref name="wcf"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Wilde |title=Profit opportunities raising sheep |url=http://www.wcfcourier.com/articles/2008/01/20/business/local/6f3309794cec83b9862573d40047bd29.txt |work=Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier |date= 2008-01-20 |accessdate=2008-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the  lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower [[overhead (business)|overhead]] for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer.&lt;ref name="wcf"/&gt; Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been [[vertically integrated]] by [[agribusiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons &amp; Ekarius, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to agriculture.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt;  Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb.  "Mutton" is derived from the [[Old French]] ''moton'', which was the word for sheep used by the [[Normans|Anglo-Norman]] rulers of much of the British Isles in the [[Middle Ages]]. This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''sceap'' was kept for the live animal.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1933: Mutton, Sheep, Beef.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout modern history, "mutton" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; "lamb" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mutton |title=Mutton |accessdate=2008-01-23 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muttonrenaissance.org.uk/whatIsMutton.php |title=What Is Mutton?

In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], New Zealand, Australia, [[Greece]], [[Uruguay]], the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; These countries eat 14–40&amp;nbsp;lbs (3–18&amp;nbsp;kg) of sheep meat [[per capita]], [[per annum]].&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ado"/&gt; Sheep meat is also popular in [[France]], Africa (especially the [[Maghreb]]), the [[Caribbean]], the rest of the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and parts of [[China]].&lt;ref name="ado"/&gt; This often reflects a history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and [[offal]] may be popular or traditional. Sheep [[testicle]]s—called [[animelles]] or [[lamb fries]]—are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish [[haggis]], composed of various sheep [[offal|innards]] cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Smith et al., p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5&amp;nbsp;kg), with Americans eating 50&amp;nbsp;pounds (22&amp;nbsp;kg) of pork and 65&amp;nbsp;pounds (29&amp;nbsp;kg) of beef.&lt;ref name="ado"/&gt; In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly [[Meat chop|lamb chops]] and [[leg of lamb]].&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt;

Though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agriportal.gov.sy/napcsyr/dwnld-files/divisions/tpd/pubs/comd_brf/en/04_cbrf_sheep_en.pdf |title=Sheep Trade in Syria |work=napcsyr.org |publisher=National Agricultural Policy Center, Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, [[Syrian Arab Republic]] |access-date=2016-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012190234/http://www.agriportal.gov.sy/napcsyr/dwnld-files/divisions/tpd/pubs/comd_brf/en/04_cbrf_sheep_en.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two [[teat]]s, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows.&lt;ref name="storey"/&gt; However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, [[Milk solids|solids]], and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process.&lt;ref name="Pulina2"/&gt; It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher [[calcium]] content.&lt;ref name="Pulina2"/&gt;  Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the [[Feta]] of [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]], [[Roquefort]] of France, [[Manchego]] from Spain, the [[Pecorino Romano cheese|Pecorino Romano]] (the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for sheep is ''pecore'') and [[Ricotta]] of [[Italy]]. Yogurts, especially some forms of [[strained yogurt]], may also be made from sheep milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Fermented Fresh Milk Products: An International Inventory |last=Kurmann |first=Joseph A. |author2=Jeremija L.

As with other domestic animals, the meat of uncastrated males is inferior in quality, especially as they grow. A "bucky" lamb is a lamb which was not castrated early enough, or which was castrated improperly (resulting in one testicle being retained). These lambs are worth less at market.&lt;ref name="buckylamb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheepandgoat.com/articles/castdockdisb.html|title=Docking, castrating, and disbudding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buckylamb2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=960bAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=bucky+lamb+sheep#v=onepage&amp;q=bucky%20lamb%20sheep&amp;f=false|title=Marketing Live Stock|year=1922|last1=American Institute Of Agriculture|first1=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buckylamb3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GDsNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=bucky+lamb+sheep#v=onepage&amp;q=bucky%20lamb%20sheep&amp;f=false|title=Kansas State Board of Agriculture report|year=1901|last1=State Board Of Agriculture|first1=Kansas|last2=Its}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the [[Roslin Institute]] of [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] used sheep for [[genetics]] research that produced groundbreaking results. In 1995, two ewes named [[Megan and Morag (cloned sheep)|Megan and Morag]] were the first mammals [[Cloning|cloned]] from [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]]. A year later, a [[Finnish Dorset]] sheep named [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]], dubbed "the world's most famous sheep" in ''[[Scientific American]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=no-more-cloning-around|title=No More Cloning Around|last=Lehrman |first=Sally|date=July 2008|work=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].

[[File:Black sheep-1.jpg|thumb|The proverbial black sheep]]

Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheep |title=Sheep |accessdate=2007-12-01 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] football team and the [[Dodge Ram]] pickup truck allude to males of the [[bighorn sheep]], ''Ovis canadensis''.

[[Counting sheep]] is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some [[Yan Tan Tethera|ancient systems of counting sheep]] persist today. Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and [[idiom]] frequently with such phrases as "[[black sheep]]". To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group.&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9re1vfFh04sC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=american+heritage+dictionary+%22black+sheep%22 |title=American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms |accessdate=2007-11-13 |isbn=978-0-395-72774-4 |author1=Ammer, Christine |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock. These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool.&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the [[Portmanteau word|Portmanteau]] [[neologism]] of [[sheeple]]. Somewhat differently, the adjective "sheepish" is also used to describe embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheepish |title=Sheepish |accessdate=2007-12-01 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and folklore===
[[File:Antikensammlung Kiel 107.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] ram-head [[rhyton]], ca. 340 BC]]

In antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the [[ancient Near East]], the [[Mideast]], and the [[Mediterranean]] area: [[Çatalhöyük]], ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, [[Judaism]], [[Greek mythology|Greek religion]], and others. Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths: Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Budiansky, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], the ram was the symbol of several gods: [[Khnum]], [[Heryshaf]] and [[Amun]] (in his incarnation as a god of [[fertility]]).&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess [[Ishtar]], the [[Phoenicia]]n god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes.&lt;ref name="hobby"/&gt; In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.&lt;ref name = Cooper92&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=JC |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |page=219 |year=1992 |publisher= Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-85538-118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ancient Greek references to sheep: that of [[Chrysomallos]], the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era. [[Astrology|Astrologically]], [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek [[zodiac]], and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the [[Chinese zodiac]], related to the [[Chinese calendar]].&lt;ref name = Cooper92/&gt; In [[Mongolia]], [[shagai]] are an ancient form of dice made from the [[cuboid bone]]s of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.

[[File:Bernhard Plockhorst - Good Shephard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is depicted as "The Good Shepherd", with the sheep being [[Christianity|Christians]]]]

Sheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]], [[King David]] and the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] were all shepherds. According to the Biblical story of the [[Binding of Isaac]], a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael). [[Eid al-Adha]] is a major annual festival in [[Islam]] in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act.&lt;ref name="Eid"&gt;{{cite web | title = Eid ul Adha (10 Dhul-Hijja) – the festival of sacrifice| publisher = BBC| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/eiduladha.shtml| accessdate = 2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sweetness"&gt;{{cite web| title = Eid Festival Around The World – Graphic photos| publisher = Sweetness &amp; Light| url = http://sweetness-light.com/archive/the-eid-festival-around-the-world-graphic-photos| accessdate = 2008-01-08| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080220050508/http://sweetness-light.com/archive/the-eid-festival-around-the-world-graphic-photos| archivedate = 2008-02-20| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important [[secular]] events in Islamic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/bloody-blessing-goes-unnoticed/?scp=8&amp;sq=sheep&amp;st=cse |title=Bloody Blessing Goes Unnoticed |last=Robertson |first=Cambpell |date=August 13, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greeks and Romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and [[Judaism]] once sacrificed sheep as a [[Korban]] (sacrifice), such as the [[Korban Pesach|Passover lamb]] .&lt;ref name = Cooper92/&gt; Ovine symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a [[shofar]]—still find a presence in modern Judaic traditions. Followers of [[Christianity]] are collectively often referred to as a flock, with Christ as the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], and sheep are an element in the Christian [[iconography]] of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|birth of Jesus]]. Some Christian [[saint]]s are considered [[Patron saints of occupations and activities|patrons of shepherds]], and even of sheep themselves. Christ is also portrayed as the [[Sacrificial lamb]] of God (''[[Agnus Dei]]'') and Easter celebrations in [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb. In many Christian traditions, a church leader is called the [[pastor]], which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd.

Sheep are key symbols in [[fable]]s and [[nursery rhyme]]s like ''[[The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing]]'', ''[[Little Bo Peep]]'', ''[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]'', and ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''; novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and [[Haruki Murakami]]'s ''[[A Wild Sheep Chase]]''; songs such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] ''[[Sheep may safely graze]]'' (''Schafe können sicher weiden'') and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]'', and poems like [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]".

'''Domestic ducks''' are [[duck]]s that are raised for [[meat]], [[egg (food)|egg]]s and [[Down feathers|down]]. Many ducks are also kept for show, as pets, or for their ornamental value. Almost all varieties of [[domestication|domestic]] duck apart from the [[Muscovy duck]] (''Cairina moschata'') are descended from the [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhynchos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digimorph.org/specimens/anas_platyrhynchos/skull/ |title=Anas platyrhynchos, Domestic Duck; DigiMorph Staff - The University of Texas at Austin |publisher=Digimorph.org |date= |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sy Montgomery |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-360302/mallard |title=Mallard; Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptian - Vase in the Shape of a Duck - Walters 48421 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|Ducks were common in [[Ancient Egypt]], as depicted in this 3rd century BC [[faience]] vase.]]

[[Mallard]] ducks were first domesticated in [[Southeast Asia]] at least 4000 years ago, during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]], and were also farmed by the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] in [[Europe]], and the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] in [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fXJBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123 |title=Bird Brains: Inside the Strange Minds of Our Fine Feathered Friends |last=Titlow |first=Budd |date=2013 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-762-79770-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfrdBcKd79wC&amp;pg=PA7 |title=Ducks, Geese and Swans: General chapters, species accounts (Anhima to Salvadorina)|last=Kear |first=Janet |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-198-61008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Egypt]], ducks were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |author=Manuelian, Peter der |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |location=Cologne, Germany|publisher=Könemann |isbn=978-3-89508-913-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Peking duck]]—mallards force-fed on grains, making them larger— was known to have good genetic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=48sgHPrbUiQC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Domestic Duck Production: Science and Practice |last=Cherry |first=Peter |last2=Morris |first2=Trevor Raymond |date=2008 |publisher=CABI |isbn=9781845934415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all varieties of domestic duck except the [[muscovy duck|muscovy]] have been derived from the [[mallard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hW6BCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq |title=Poultry Behaviour and Welfare|last=Appleby|first=Michael C.|last2=Mench|first2=Joy A.|last3=Hughes|first3=Barry O. |date=2004 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-0-851-99667-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestication has greatly altered their characteristics.

== Farming ==
[[File:Taiwanese duck farm.jpg|thumb|left|A duck farm in Taiwan]]

Ducks have been farmed for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge World History of Food |last1=Kiple |first1=Kenneth F. |last2=Ornelas |first2=Kriemhild Coneè |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-40214-9 |oclc=44541840}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], they are not as popular as the [[chicken]], because chickens have much more white lean meat and are easier to keep confined, making the total price much lower for [[chicken meat]], whereas [[duck (food)|duck]] is comparatively expensive. While popular in ''[[haute cuisine]]'', duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry and restaurants in the lower price range. However, ducks are more popular in [[China]] and there they are raised extensively.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Ducks are farmed for their meat, [[egg]]s, and [[Down feather|down]]. A minority of ducks are also kept for ''[[foie gras]]'' production. The [[blood as food|blood]] of ducks slaughtered for meat is also collected in some regions and is used as an ingredient in many cultures' dishes. Their eggs are blue-green to white, depending on the breed.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Ducks can be kept [[free range]], in cages, in barns, or in [[battery farming|batteries]]. Ducks enjoy access to swimming water, but do not require it to survive. They should be fed a [[grain]] and [[insect]] diet. It is a popular misconception that ducks should be fed [[bread]]; bread has limited nutritional value and can be deadly when fed to developing ducklings. Ducks should be monitored for [[avian influenza]], as they are especially prone to infection with the dangerous [[H5N1]] strain.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The females of many breeds of domestic ducks are unreliable at sitting their eggs and raising their young. Exceptions include the [[Rouen duck]] and especially the [[Muscovy duck]]. It has been a custom on farms for centuries to put duck eggs under [[chicken#Current|broody hens]] for hatching; nowadays this role is often played by an [[wikt:incubator|incubator]]. However, young ducklings rely on their mothers for a supply of [[preen oil]] to make them waterproof; a chicken hen does not make as much preen oil as a female duck, and an incubator makes none. Once the duckling grows its own feathers, it produces preen oil from the sebaceous gland near the base of its tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zooenc.eu/en/ducks/ | title=Ducks - Poultry Breeds Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic ducks can be kept as pets, in a garden or backyard, generally with a pond or deep water dish. If they are given access to a pond, they dabble in the mud, dredging out and eating wildlife and [[frog spawn]], and swallow adult [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s up to the size of the [[common frog]] ''Rana temporaria'', as they have been bred to be much bigger than wild ducks, with a waterline length (base of neck to base of tail) of up to {{convert|1|ft|cm}}; the wild [[mallard]]'s waterline length is about {{convert|6|in|cm}}. Protection from predators such as [[fox]]es and [[hawk]]s is required.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Link|first1=Kimberly|title=The Ultimate Pet Duck Guidebook|date=2014|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1500344771}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ducks are also kept for their ornamental value. Breeds have been developed with crests and tufts or striking plumage, for exhibition in competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The best ducks to keep in your garden: in pictures|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/9139166/The-best-ducks-to-keep-in-your-garden-in-pictures.html|accessdate=28 June 2017|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jemima1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beatrix Potter]]'s 1908 ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'']]

The domestic duck has appeared numerous times in children's stories. [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'' was published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in 1908. One of Potter's best-known books, the tale was included in the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet's]] ''[[The Tales of Beatrix Potter]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/8203999/The-Tales-of-Beatrix-Potter-performed-by-The-Royal-Ballet.html|title=The Tales of Beatrix Potter performed by The Royal Ballet|last=Roberts|first=Laura|date=2010-12-16|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821213751/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/8203999/The-Tales-of-Beatrix-Potter-performed-by-The-Royal-Ballet.html|archive-date=2016-08-21|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the story of how Jemima, a domestic duck, is saved from a cunning fox who plans to kill her, when she tries to find a safe place for her eggs to hatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=nXYS8DlO6T4C|title=Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck |last=Potter |first=Beatrix|date=1993 |publisher=Frederick Warne|isbn=9781854713858|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In music ===

The domestic duck features in the musical composition ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', written by [[Sergei Prokofiev]] in 1936.

The duck is represented by the [[oboe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3025">'''Estray''', in law, is any [[domestic animal]] found wandering at large or lost, particularly if the owner is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/estray|title=Estray|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases this includes domesticated animals and not pets.

Under early English [[common law]], estrays were forfeited to the king or lord of the manor; under modern statutes, provision is made for taking up stray animals and acquiring either title to them or a lien for the expenses incurred in keeping them. A person taking up an estray has a qualified ownership in it, which becomes absolute if the owner fails to claim the animal within the statutory time limit. Whether the animal escaped through the owner's negligence or through the wrongful act of a third person is immaterial. If the owner reclaims the estray, he is liable for reasonable costs of its upkeep. The use of an estray during the period of qualified ownership, other than for its own preservation or for the benefit of the owner, is not authorized. Some statutes limit the right to take up estrays to certain classes of persons, to certain seasons or places, or to animals requiring care.

When public officials, such as a county [[sheriff]] impound stray animals, they may sell them at auction to recover the costs of upkeep, with proceeds, if any, going into the public treasury.   In some places, an uncastrated male [[livestock]] animal running at large may be [[castration|neutered]] at the owner's expense.

It is common in the US for there to be a required "Notice of Estray" sworn and filed in a local office. The process usually takes a prescribed time to permit the property owner to collect his property. Otherwise, the finder obtains title to the property.

{{Quotation|'''ESTRAYS'''

'''1 Definition.''' There is no strictly accurate definition of an estray to be found in any reported decision but from all of them may be deduced the following: An estray is an animal, by nature tame and reclaimable, having a value as property generally recognized by law, as a sheep, ox, hog, or horse, which is found wandering and the owner of which is unknown. Animals on which the law sets no value as a dog or cat and animals ''ferae naturae'' as a bear or wolf cannot be considered as estrays.

'''2 Right to Forfeit.'''  a. '''At Common Law''' The right to forfeit the title of the owner to estrays has been recognized from a very remote period. At the common law they were originally forfeited to the king as the general owner and lord paramount of the soil; and later they most commonly belonged to the lord of the manor by special grant from the crown.|From ''The American and English Encyclopaedia Law and Practice'', 1910, Vol. III, p. 1030&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHAsAQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Drazet, a black feral cat.jpg|225px|right|thumb|A [[black cat|black]] [[Domestic shorthair cat|domestic shorthair]]. The domestic shorthair is one of a number of landraces of the [[domestic cat]].]]
A '''landrace''' is a [[Domestication|domesticated]], locally adapted,&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO Reviewing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones 2008" /&gt; traditional variety&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt; of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through [[adaptation]] to its natural and cultural [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] of [[agriculture]] and [[pastoralism]], and due to isolation from other populations of the species.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt; Landraces are generally distinguished from [[cultivars]], and from [[breed]]s in the standardized sense, although the term '''landrace breed''' is sometimes used as distinguished from the term ''standardized breed'' when referring to cattle.&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary" /&gt;

Specimens of a landrace tend to be relatively genetically uniform, but are more diverse than members of a standardized or formal breed.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt; Some standardized animal breeds originate from attempts to make landraces more consistent through [[selective breeding]] and a landrace may become a more formal breed with the creation of a [[breed registry]] and/or publication of a [[breed standard]].  In such a case, the landrace may be thought of as a "stage" in breed development. However, in other cases, formalizing a landrace may result in the genetic resource of a landrace being lost through [[crossbreeding]].&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sponenberg |first=D. Phillip |chapter=Genetic Resources and Their Conservation |pages=392–393 |editor1-last=Bowling|editor1-first=Ann T. |editor2-last=Ruvinsky |editor2-first=Anatoly |title=The Genetics of the Horse |date=May 18, 2000 |publisher=CABI Publishing |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK |isbn=0-85199-429-6 |url= //Books.Google.com/books?id=ZL3A097IbjsC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392#v=onepage&amp;q=Landrace%20horses |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Landraces are distinct from ancestral wild [[species]] of modern stock, and from separate species or subspecies derived from the same ancestor as modern domestic stock. Landraces are not all derived from ancient stock largely unmodified by human breeding interests. In a number of cases, most commonly dogs and horses, domestic animals have escaped in sufficient numbers in an area to breed [[feral]] populations that, through [[evolutionary pressure]], can form new landraces in only a few centuries. In other cases, simple failure to maintain breeding regimens can do the same.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--source cited at end is only about plants--&gt;  For example, selectively bred cultivars can become new landraces when loosely selective reproduction is applied.&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt;

Ernesto|last3=Méndez |work=Agricultural Systems |issue=111 |date=2012 |pages=63–74 |url= //UVM.edu/giee/pubpdfs/Olson_2012_Agricultural_Systems.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; has led to a reduction in [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  The majority of the [[genetic diversity]] of domesticated species lies in landraces and other traditionally used varieties,&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt; a "reservoir of [[Germplasm|genetic resources]]".&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
General features that characterize a landrace may include:&lt;!--Distinguish plant from animal here where there are distinctions in definition.--&gt;

* It is [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinctive and identifiable (i.e., has particular and recognizable characteristics or properties),&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; yet remains "dynamic".&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;
* It is genetically adapted to,&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt; and has a reputation for being able to withstand,&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; the conditions of the local environment, including [[climate]], [[disease]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]], even [[Culture|cultural]] practices.&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt;
* It is not the product of formal (governmental, organizational, or private) [[breeding program]]s,&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt; and may lack systematic selection, development and improvement by breeders.&lt;ref name="Jones 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;
* It is maintained and fostered less deliberately than a standardized breed, with its genetic isolation principally a matter of geography acting upon whatever animals that happened to be brought by humans to a given area.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;
* It has a historical origin in a specific geographic area,&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt; will usually have its own local name(s),&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; and will often be classified according to intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt;
* Where yield (e.g. of a grain or fruit crop) can be measured, a landrace will show high stability of yield, even under adverse conditions, but a moderate yield {{em|level}}, even under carefully managed conditions.&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt;
* At the level of [[genetic testing]], its heredity will show a degree of integrity,&lt;ref name="Harlan 1" /&gt; but still some [[genetic heterogeneity]]&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt; (i.e. [[genetic diversity]]).&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harlan 2" /&gt;

Not every source on the topic enumerates each of these criteria, and they may be weighted differently depending on a given source's focus (e.g., governmental [[regulation]], [[Biology|biological sciences]], [[agribusiness]], [[Cultural anthropology|anthropology]] and culture, environmental [[Conservation biology|conservation]], [[pet]] keeping and breeding, etc.).  Additionally, not all cultivars agreed to be landraces exhibit all possible landrace characteristics.&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;  Plant landraces have been the subject of more intensive study, and the majority of the academic literature about landraces is focused on [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[botany]], not [[animal husbandry]].  Most plant landraces are associated with traditional agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camacho Villa|first1=Taina Carolina |last2=Maxted|first2=Nigel |last3=Scholten|first3=Maria |last4=Ford-Lloyd|first4=Brian |title=Defining and Identifying Crop Landraces |date=December 2005 |work=Plant Genetic Resources |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=373–384 |doi=10.1079/PGR200591 |url= //Journals.Cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=689208&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1479262105000420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many landrace animals are associated with farming, other domestic animals have been put to use as modes of transportation, as [[companion animal]]s, for sporting purposes, and for other non-farming uses, so their geographic distribution may differ. For example, horse landraces are less common because human use of them for transport has meant that they have moved with people more commonly and constantly than most other domestic animals, reducing the incidence of populations locally genetically isolated for extensive periods of time.&lt;ref name="Sponenberg 2000" /&gt;

==Terminology==

J. Mansholt, who wrote that landraces have better "stability of their characteristics" and "resistance capacity to tolerate adverse influences" but lower production capacity than cultivars, and are apt to change genetically when moved to another environment.&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt; H. Kiessling added in 1912 that a landrace is a mixture of phenotypic forms despite relative outward uniformity, and a great adaptability to its natural and human environment.&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt;  The word entered non-academic English in the early 1930s, by way of the [[Danish Landrace pig]], a particular breed of lop-eared swine.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com" /&gt;

Aside from some standardized breeds having "Landrace" in their names, actual landraces and standardized breeds are sometimes further confused when the word "breed" is used very broadly.  As one example, a glossary in a [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) guideline defines ''landrace'' or ''landrace breed'' (treated synonymously) as "a breed that has largely developed through adaptation to the natural environment and traditional production system in which it has been raised".&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Glossary of Selected Terms |title=''In Vivo'' Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources |pages=xv–xx |author=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |series=FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines |issue=14 |issn=1810-0708 |url= http://FAO.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;!--Site does not support https.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also defines ''breed'' expansively and in multiple ways, with a focus on treating differing senses, landrace breed and standardized breed, as equivalent for "genetic management" purposes, the focus of the FAO guideline.&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary" /&gt;  It does clearly distinguish between the two concepts, however, both with a distinct definition of "standardized breed"&lt;ref name="FAO Glossary" /&gt; and in the main body of the guideline, referring to the "interaction between landraces and standardized breeds"),&lt;ref name="FAO Reviewing"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Reviewing the Roles of Animal Genetic Resources and Options for Their Conservation |title=''In Vivo'' Conservation of Animal Genetic Resources |pages=4–5 |author=Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |series=FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines |issue=14 |issn=1810-0708 |url= http://FAO.org/docrep/018/i3327e/i3327e.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;!--Site does not support https.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and that FAO document uses "breed" to mean "the unit of conservation, i.e. the specific population of animals that is to be conserved".&lt;ref name="FAO Reviewing" /&gt;  Similarly, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''landrace'' as a "local cultivar or animal breed that has been improved by traditional agricultural methods",&lt;ref name="OED landrace"&gt;{{cite web |url= //OxfordDictionaries.com/definition/english/landrace |title=Definition of ''landrace'' in English |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; without specifying which definition of ''breed'' is cross-referenced.&lt;ref name="OED breed"&gt;{{cite web |url= //OxfordDictionaries.com/definition/english/breed |title=Definition of ''breed'' in English |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |date=2014 |publisher=&lt;!--ibid.: Oxford University Press--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The definition is also at odds with some peer-reviewed material, in which lack of formal, scientific breeding for genetic improvement (e.g. uniformity and stability) is characteristic of landraces;&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt; such sources&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt; clearly distinguish landraces from cultivars.)

A landrace native to, or produced for a long time (e.g. 100 years or longer)&lt;ref name="Zeven" /&gt; within the agricultural system in which it is found is referred to as an ''[[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] landrace'', while an introduced one is termed an '''allochthonous landrace'''.&lt;ref name="FAO B.1"&gt;{{cite book |url=//FAO.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/seeds-pgr/resource-book/en/ |format=PDF |title=Resource Book for the Preparation of National Plans for Conservation of Crop Wild Relatives and Landraces |chapter=Section B.

Many languages do not use separate terms, like ''landrace'' and ''breed'' in English, but instead rely on extended description to convey such distinctions.{{efn|1=As an example of lack of distinction at the nomenclature level between breeds and landraces in other languages, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''{{lang|es|raza}}'' ('race') covers the concepts of both breed and landrace, as well as [[Race (biology)|biological race]], and [[Race (human classification)|race as a human classification]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}}} The FAO notes: "The distinction between breeds and ecotypes within breeds is not very objective, and generally involves cultural rather than genetic factors."&lt;ref name="FAO Vivo" /&gt;

The term '''landrace breed''' is sometimes encountered.&lt;ref name="FAO Vivo" /&gt; In various domestic species (including pigs, goats, sheep and geese) some standardized breeds include "Landrace" in their names, and "Landrace breeds" (with capital "L") is sometimes used to refer to them collectively.{{efn|1=The British Pig Association uses "Landrace breed", in reference to standardized breeds, e.g. "new lines ... making the British Landrace pig unique among other Landrace breeds throughout the world".&lt;ref name="BPA"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The British Landrace: Breed History |work=BritishPigs.org.uk |publisher=British Pig Association |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |location=Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, UK |date=2014&lt;!--last updated--&gt; |accessdate=30 September 2014 |url= http://BritishPigs.org.uk/breed_la.htm}}&lt;!--Site does not support https.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[British Landrace pig]] is a standardized breed, derived from earlier breeds with "Landrace" names.&lt;ref name="BPA" /&gt;  BPA's breed-specific usage is commonly found in various other publications.}} but may be used more ambiguously to include actual landraces.{{efn|1=One example of general and specific use in the same document, is an article in a UN FAO journal that refers to "landrace breeds" in its title, but distinguishes between formal breeds like [[Nguni cattle]], the [[Boer goat]] and "indigenous pig breeds" on the one hand, and "indigenous sheep landraces" on the other.&lt;ref name="Ramsay"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Adding Value to South African Landrace Breeds Conservation through Utilisation |first1=K. |last1=Ramsay |first2=M. |last2=Smuts |first3=H.

Similar ambiguity may be encountered in the use of terms such as '''ancient breed''', '''native breed''' (not to be confused with [[native species]]), '''old breed''', and '''[[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] breed'''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--The specific terms should be sourced.--&gt;  '''Farmers' variety''', usually applied to local cultivars, or seen as intermediate between a landrace and a cultivar,&lt;ref name="Ramanandan" /&gt; may also include landraces when referring to plant varieties not subjected to formal breeding programs.&lt;ref name="Participatory" /&gt;&lt;!--These two citations only source the sentence in which they appear.--&gt;

The term ''breed'' itself has multiple definitions and uses,{{efn|E.g.

For example, the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA) guideline provides a definition of "breed", for "genetic management" purposes, that overlaps with many definitions of ''landrace'', and defines "landrace (or landrace breed)" as a type of "breed".&lt;ref name="FAO Vivo"&gt;''In Vivo'' Conservation, FAO glossary, pp. xv–xx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodiversity and conservation==
Due to their adaptation to the local environment, some farmers using scientifically "improved" domesticates also continue to raise landraces, because the latter often exhibit benefits,&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt; ranging from lower cost, and cultural (e.g. culinary) preference, to superior hardiness in a less-than-ideal climate, and better disease resistance.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  There may be more variety-specific pluses; a plant landrace may have, e.g., lower fertilizer requirements, or something about a plant or animal product's texture, color or ease of use might be a major factor.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;

Landraces are often free from many [[intellectual property]] and other regulatory encumbrances.  However, in some jurisdictions, a focus on their production may result in missing out on some benefits afforded to producers of genetically selected and homogenous organisms, including breeders' rights legislation, easier availability of loans and other business services, even the right to share seed or stock with others, depending on how favorable the laws in the area are to high-yield agribusiness interests.&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite web |url=//InWEnt.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |title=An Issue of Survival |first=Regine |last=Andersen |work=Development &amp; Cooperation |date=April 2010 |volume=51 |issue=04 |publisher=[[Internationale Weiterbildung und Entwicklung]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085330/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/169196/index.en.shtml |archivedate=2011-09-27 |accessdate=August 6, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Regine Andersen of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute (Norway) and the Farmers' Rights Project puts it, "Agricultural biodiversity is being eroded. This trend is putting at risk the ability of future generations to feed themselves. In order to reverse the trend, new policies must be implemented worldwide. The irony of the matter is that the poorest farmers are the stewards of genetic diversity."&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;  Protecting farmer interests and protecting biodiversity is at the heart of the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]] (the "Plant Treaty" for short), under the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), though its concerns are not exclusively limited to landraces.&lt;ref name="Andersen" /&gt;

In 2005, a "working definition" of plant landraces was proposed: "a dynamic population(s) of a cultivated plant that has historical origin, distinct identity and lacks formal crop improvement, as well as often being genetically diverse, locally adapted and associated with traditional farming systems".&lt;ref name="Camacho Villa 2005" /&gt; Another definition, dating to 1975, of the term ''landrace'' as used in [[botany]] (and by extension in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], [[anthropology]], etc.) was provided by J. R. Harlan: {{bq
|1="Landrace populations are often highly variable in appearance, but they are each identifiable [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] and have a certain genetic integrity.  Farmers usually give them local names. A landrace has particular properties or characteristics. Some are considered early maturing and some late. Each has a reputation for adaptation to particular [[soil types]] according to the traditional peasant soil classifications, e.g. heavy or light, warm or cold, dry or wet, strong or weak. They also may be classified according to expected usage; among cereals, different landraces are used for flour, for porridge, for '[[bulgur]]', and for malt to make beer, etc. All components of the [plant] population are adapted to local climatic conditions, cultural practices, and disease and pests."&lt;ref name="Harlan 1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harlan |first=J.

===Development===
Landrace plants are grown from seeds which have not been systematically selected and marketed by seed companies, nor developed by plant breeders. &lt;!-- Participatory might source this?--&gt;The label ''landraces'' includes all those regional [[cultigen]]s that are highly [[heterogeneous]], but with enough characteristics in common to permit their recognition as a group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

This includes all cultigens cultivated without any specific [[nomenclature]] and value. A landrace identified with a unique feature, and selected for uniformity over a period of time for maintenance of the characteristic features of the population, can evolve into a "farmers' variety", or even a modern [[cultivar]] as in many crops (for example, ''Cajanus cajan'' 'Maruti' in the case of [[pigeon pea]]s).&lt;ref name="Ramanandan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramanandan |first=P. |chapter=Pigeonpea: Genetic Resources |pages=89–116 |title=The Pigeonpea |editor=Nene, Y.L. |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a modern cultivar grown over time can "evolve" into a landrace, especially when [[Self-pollination|self-seeded]] and some human selection is applied.&lt;ref name="Participatory"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friis-Hansen |first1=Esbern |last2=Sthapit |first2=Bhuwon (eds.) |title=Participatory Approaches to the Conservation and Use of Plant Genetic Resources |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute |location=Rome, Italy |date=2000 |page=199 |isbn=92-9043-444-9 |url= //Books.Google.com/books?id=5oSB_Dmwio4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various distinctive landraces of [[domestic cat]] around the world, including the [[Aegean cat|Aegean]], [[Cyprus cat|Cyprus]], [[domestic long-haired]], [[domestic short-haired]], [[Kellas cat|Kellas]] and [[Sokoke]], among others.

Many standardized breeds have rather recently (within a century or less) been derived from landraces.  Examples, often called ''natural breeds'', include [[Arabian Mau]], [[Egyptian Mau]], [[Korat]], [[Kurilian Bobtail]], [[Maine Coon]], [[Manx cat|Manx]], [[Norwegian Forest Cat]], [[Siberian cat|Siberian]], and [[Thai cat|Thai]] (which is the landrace ancestor of modern Siamese cats), among many others.&lt;!--See those main articles for sources for now, cite here too before GA review.--&gt;

Landrace dogs have more variety in their appearance than do standardized dog breeds.&lt;ref name=Mother/&gt; An example of a dog landrace with a related standardized breed with a similar name is the [[collie]].  The [[Scotch Collie]] is a landrace, while the [[Rough Collie]] and the [[Border Collie]] are standardized breeds.  They can be very different in appearance, though the Rough Collie in particular was developed from the Scotch Collie by inbreeding to fix certain highly desired traits. In contrast to the landrace, in the various standardized Collie breeds, [[purebred]] individuals closely match a breed-standard appearance but might have lost other useful characteristics and have developed undesirable traits linked to inbreeding.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Andy|title=Landrace vs. Purebred Scotch Collies|url= //OldtimeFarmShepherd.org/current-collie-articles/landrace-vs-purebred-scotch-collies/ |work=Old-Time Farm Shepherd: Dedicated to Bringing Back the Old Scotch Collie of Yesterday |publisher=Old-time Scotch Collie Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the ancient landrace dogs of the [[Fertile Crescent]] that led to the [[Saluki]] breed excels in running down [[Game (food)|game]] across open tracts of hot desert, but [[Conformation (dog)|conformation]]-bred individuals of the breed might not be able to chase and catch desert [[hare]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[Mulefoot pig]] breed originated as a landrace, but has been a standardized breed since the early 1900s.  The standardized swine breeds named "Landrace" are not actually landraces, and often not even derived from one, but from other breeds with "Landrace" in their names. The [[Danish Landrace pig]] breed, pedigreed in 1896 from the actual local landrace, is the principal ancestor of the [[American Landrace pig|American Landrace]] (1930s). The [[Swedish Landrace pig|Swedish Landrace]] is derived from the Danish and from other Scandinavian breeds, as was the [[British Landrace pig|British Landrace]] breed, which was established as late as 1950.

Domesticated species and the human populations that domesticate them are typified by a mutualistic relationship of interdependence, in which humans have over thousands of years modified the '''genomics of domesticated species'''. Genomics is the study of the structure, content, and [[evolution]] of [[genomes]], or the entire genetic information of organisms.&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Greg|title=A Primer of Genome Science|year=2009|publisher=Sinauer Associates|location=Sunderland, MA|isbn=978-0-87893-236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestication is the process by which humans alter the morphology and [[genes]] of targeted organisms by selecting for desirable traits.

==Background==
Since [[domestication]] involves selection of traits over time, which leads to genetic changes, the science of [[genomics]] can identify which genes across an entire genome are altered during this intense [[artificial selection]] period. Understanding the genomics of domestication can also offer insight into the genetic effects of both the [[artificial selection|artificial]], human driven [[Selection (biology)|selection]] of domestication, as well as [[natural selection]]. This makes the genomics of domestication a unique tool for examining the [[genetics]] of evolution in organisms that are relatively easy to study as their history may be more thoroughly preserved due to their usefulness to humans.

==Genomics as a tool==
[[File:Ancient rice.png|thumb|right|diversity of ancestral rice]]
Historically genomic studies have been focused on select organisms for which there is funding to study. Initially, when [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] costs were prohibitive, this was limited to organisms with small genomes, such as viruses and bacteria, and then in [[eukaryotes]], model organisms of importance to the scientific community for research.  These included the ''[[Mus musculus]]'' (the house mouse), ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (fruit fly) and ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (''Arabidopsis'') genomes. One of the most prominent publicly funded genome projects was the [[Human Genome Project]] which helped to refine existing sequencing techniques as well as develop additional ones. Following these model organisms, agriculturally important species were next emphasized. As of 2009, there are more than 50 plant species whose genomes are being sequenced.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt; However, the most important agricultural crops, including those in the grass and legume families such as [[rice]], [[wheat]] and [[maize]], have received the most attention and funding. As of 2005, a full [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of the rice genome has been published.&lt;ref name="gibson" /&gt; These domesticated species and in some cases, their wild ancestors, have received focus due to their agricultural and economic importance and the benefits that having a sequenced genome for these species confers such as the ability to easily identify targets for selective breeding programs to increase yield, facilitate drought tolerance, or select a variety of desirable traits.

==Genetics and genomics of domestication==
During domestication, crop species undergo intense selective pressures that alter their genomes. The process of selection during domestication has largely focused on core traits that have come to define domesticated species. In seed or grain crops, these hallmark traits include increases in seed size, a reduction in natural [[seed dispersal]], reduced lateral branching, and an annual life cycle.&lt;ref name="puru"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Purugganan|first=Michael|author2=Dorian Fuller|title=The nature of selection during plant domestication|journal=Nature|date=February 2009|volume=457|series=12|doi=10.1038/nature07895|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7231/abs/nature07895.html|accessdate=28 November 2011|issue=7231|pmid=19212403|pages=843–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes that code for these traits have been elucidated in some species, such as the maize tb1 gene, which controls for lateral branching, using classical genetic techniques as well as genomics. However, traditional [[Mendelian genetics]] which examines inheritance patterns on an individual trait basis is limited to traits or [[phenotype]]s that cleanly segregate into distinct classes.  Genomics is able to overcome this limitation through the [[Comparative genomics|comparison of the genomes]] of individuals exhibiting a trait or phenotype of interest to a [[reference genome]] which enables the identification differences between the two genomes such as [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNP), the movement of [[transposable element]]s (or [[retrotransposon]]s) or deletions, among other genetic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gepts|first=Paul|title=Crop Domestication as a long-term selection experiment|journal=Plant Breeding Reviews|year=2004|volume=24|series=2|url=http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/gepts/LTS.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coding DNA===
Genomics offers insight into coding DNA  as well as [[noncoding DNA]]. By comparing the sequence of a previously isolated section of [[chromosome]] 8 in rice between fragrant and non-fragrant varietals researchers were able to determine their genetic difference. The aromatic and fragrant rices, including [[basmati]] and [[Jasmine rice|jasmine]] are derived from an ancestral rice domesticate that suffered a deletion in [[exon]] 7 and as a result sequence coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) was altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shao|first=G|author2=A. Tang |author3=S. Q. Tang |author4=J. Luo |author5=G. A. Jiao |author6=J. L. Wu |author7=P. S. Hu |title=A new deletion mutation of fragrant gene and the development of three molecular markers for fragrance in rice|journal=Plant Breeding|date=April 2011|volume=130|series=2|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01764.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01764.x/abstract |pages=172–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncoding DNA===
However, looking solely at genes, or coding DNA, can be ineffective when examining certain traits or studying the evolution of a species during the domestication process. Genes that are vital for cellular process are often highly [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] and mutations at these locations can prove fatal. Areas of the genome that are noncoding can be prone to much higher mutation rates. Because of this, these noncoding genes provide vital information when studying the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of wild and domestic species. Since core genes are conserved between and among species, examining DNA sequences for these genes in multiple individuals of a species may be unable to provide much information on the diversity present in a population or species that is young. The estimated age of domesticated animal and plant species tends to be less than 10,000 years, which on an evolutionary timescale, is relatively short.&lt;ref name="zeder"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeder|first=Melinda |author2=Eve Emshwiller |author3=Bruce D. Smith |author4=Daniel G. Bradley|title=Documenting domestication: the intersection of genetics and archaeology|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=March 2006|volume=22|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.01.007|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(06)00026-6|accessdate=28 November 2011|pmid=16458995|pages=139–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, highly variable noncoding DNA, such as [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]]s, that mutate frequently, provide genetic markers with sufficient intraspecific variation to document domestication.&lt;ref name="zeder" /&gt; Studying the noncoding DNA of domesticated species is made possible by genomics, which provides the genetic sequence of the entire genome, not simply coding DNA from genes of interest. In the case of [[coconut]]s, recent genomic research using 10 microsatellite loci was able to determine that there have been 2 cases of coconut domestication based on sufficient variation between individuals found in the [[Indian Ocean]] and those found in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Bee|author2=Luc Baudouin |author3=Kenneth M.

===Advantages of genomics over traditional genetics===
Genomics offers various benefits that the study of single genes, or genetics, does not. Having a fully sequenced genome for an organism, such as [[potato]], allows researchers to compare DNA across multiple species and examine conserved sequences. In 2011, researchers at the Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium compared a de novo potato genome to 12 other species including arabidopsis, [[grape]], rice, [[sorghum]], maize, [[Populus|poplar]], and others that allowed them to isolate potato specific genes, including those that confer resistance to potato blight caused by ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium|title=Genome sequence and analysis of the tuber crop potato|journal=Nature|date=July 2011|volume=475|doi=10.1038/nature10158|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v475/n7355/full/nature10158.html|accessdate=28 November 2011|issue=7355|pmid=21743474|pages=189–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to predict genes of interest for crop breeding is a major advantage to the further domestication of crop species that is facilitated by genomics and the identification of genes and extragenic sequences that control for these desirable traits. Modern plant breeders can use this information to manipulate the genetics of crop species to develop new domesticated varieties with desired modern traits such as increased yield and the ability to respond better to [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizer]]s. Comparative genomics also allows researchers to make inferences about the evolution of life through comparing genomic sequences and examining patterns of divergence and conservation.

==Evolution==
In his most famous work, ''[[Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] compared natural selection to domestication  to help explain the former and he went on to write an entire book on the topic entitled ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross-Ibarra|first=Jeffery|author2=Peter L. Morrell |author3=Brandon S. Gaut |title=Plant domestication, a unique opportunity to identify the genetic basis of adaptation|journal=PNAS|date=May 2007|volume=104|doi=10.1073/pnas.0700643104|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/suppl.1/8641.abstract|accessdate=28 November 2011|pages=8641–8648|pmid=17494757|pmc=1876441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticated species serve as ideal model systems for examining key concepts of evolution because their history is relatively short (on the evolutionary scale of billions of years) and well preserved. Additionally, by virtue of their usefulness to humans, many domesticated species are [[Extant taxon|extant]] and available for study. The genomes of crop species have been sequenced in part to help with their improvement for [[Agricultural economics|agronomic]] reasons, but because genome data are publicly available, in many cases for free, these organisms also serve as systems for examining the effects of evolution and artificial selection on genes. In particular, the genomics of domesticated species allow for the study of strong [[artificial selection]], [[Founder effect|founder events]] and [[Population bottleneck|bottlenecks]], as well as wider evolutionary questions.

The process of domestication, by which only a choice few wild individuals are cultivated and selected against, often results in very strong selective pressures. This is evident in the genomes of these individuals as a lack of genetic diversity. In some cases this lack of diversity is seen as a [[selective sweep]], whereby the variation at a particular [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] of the genome is highly reduced while variation outside of this area is maintained or only partially reduced.&lt;ref name="puru" /&gt; In other cases, such as the coconut, genomic studies have revealed occurrences of a founder event, whereby the genetic diversity of an entire population is reduced due to a small number of individuals with low diversity being the isolated ancestors of a larger modern population.&lt;ref name="coco" /&gt; Bottlenecks, where variation is reduced throughout the entire genome, are also evident in crop species such as [[pearl millet]], [[cotton]], [[common bean]] and [[lima bean]].&lt;ref name="zeder" /&gt; With the identification of bottlenecks in these species, researchers are able to study the effects on an organisms' ability to evolve past a bottleneck, and what effects this may have on the genomes of both individuals and populations as well as their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]].

==Domesticated species and human history==
Domesticated species and the human populations that domesticate them are typified by a mutualistic relationship of interdependence.&lt;ref name="zeder" /&gt; Domesticated crop species tend to become increasingly reliant on human populations for dispersal due to the selection against natural seed dispersal methods and humans have become increasingly dependent on domesticated crop species to sustain growing populations.&lt;ref name="puru" /&gt; Because many crop species rely on humans for dispersal, and it is possible to use genomics to track the dispersal of domesticated species, the genomics of domesticated species can be used as a tool to track human movements throughout history.

The [[bottle gourd]] (''Lagenaria siceraria'') is a domesticated species that originated in Africa and was dispersed throughout Asia by 9000 B.C.E. and reached the Americas by 8000 B.C.E. [[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]] and genetically, the Asian and African bottle gourds are sufficiently different that they can be designated as two separate [[subspecies]]. Morphologically the American gourd resembles the African gourds more than the Asian gourds, which was previously used as support for the theory that the American variety is derived from a wild African gourd that floated across the ocean. However, in 2005 researchers with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] were able to use a combination of [[archeological]] and genomic data to show that the bottle gourds in the Americas are actually more similar to Asian gourds, which suggests that the American gourds may be derived from Asian gourds that were carried across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] by [[Paleo-Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erickson|first=David|author2=Bruce D.

===Coconut===
Genomic analysis of cultivated [[coconut]] (''Cocos nucifera'') has shed light on the movements of [[Austronesian peoples]]. By examining 10 microsatelite loci, researchers found that there are 2 genetically distinct subpopulations of coconut – one originating in the Indian Ocean, the other in the Pacific Ocean. However, there is evidence of [[Genetic admixture|admixture]], the transfer of genetic material, between the two populations. Given that coconuts are ideally suited for ocean dispersal, it seems possible that individuals from one population could have floated to the other. However, the locations of the admixture events are limited to [[Madagascar]] and coastal east Africa and exclude the [[Seychelles]]. This pattern coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors. Additionally, there is a genetically distinct sub-population of coconuts on the Pacific coast of Latin America which has undergone a genetic bottleneck, resulting from a founder effect; however, its ancestral population is the pacific coconut, which suggests that Austronesian peoples may have sailed as far east as the Americas.&lt;ref name="coco" /&gt;

'''Kohaku''' ({{Nihongo|[[:ja:紅白 (ニシキゴイ)|紅白]]|kōhaku|"red and white"}}) is a variety of ornamental [[koi]] ([[carp]]).  The Kohaku has a white (shiro)  body, with red (aka)  markings, or 'hi', across the body. The Kohaku is one of the gosanke; the ‘Big Three’, consisting of Kohaku, Sanke, and Showa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mitchkoi.co.uk/koikeepingtips/koi-varieties/ | title=Guide to Kohaku Koi Variety | accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kohaku breed is believed to be one of the first ornamental carp varieties developed.  The variety dates to 1888, when a man named Kunizo Hiroi bred a red-headed female koi with one of his own males, whose markings resembled cherry blossoms, thus creating the now extinct Gosuke bloodline from which all of the known Kohaku bloodlines established (Tomoin, Sensuke, Yagozen, Manzo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpks.org/articles/RayJordan/KoiHistory4.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723111345/http://www.mpks.org/articles/RayJordan/KoiHistory4.shtml |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }} Ray Jordan Koi History&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Tomoin and Yagozen are the two remaining major Kohaku bloodlines in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koi-uk.co.uk/koiman/ogawa_kohaku.htm Koiman UK&lt;/ref&gt; The Kohaku remains one of the most popular breeds in Japan. The bright red markings are known as {{Nihongo|''hi''|緋}}.

==Characteristics==
Kohaku are bred to have the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Tamadachi. p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''hi'' (red markings) should be bright, and the colour should be even across the whole of the body.  The ''hi'' should not have white scales within them (this is considered a serious fault).  The markings should be balanced, although not strictly symmetrical.
# The edges of the ''hi'' should be well defined.  The edges are never as sharp near the head as they are near the tail, but they should still be of a good standard.
# The ''hi'' should not extend past the eyes, not into the fins, but this standard is not strictly adhered to.
# The ''hi'' should not extend past the lateral line.  This requirement dates from a time then all koi were viewed in a pond from the top.  Fish bred to be kept in tanks may not necessarily adhere to his standard.
# The ''hi'' should not spread beyond the nostrils, nor should it extend to the tail fin.
# There must be ''hi'' on the head of the fish.  Fish without hi on the head are called {{Nihongo|bozu|坊主|bōzu}}, which refers to the shaven head of a buddhist monk: this is considered a fault.

==Standards==
These are Japanese exhibition standards, and fish purchased simply for display in private homes or to be kept as pets, do not necessarily adhere to these standards.  There are a number of words used to describe the markings on a kohaku:&lt;ref&gt;Tamadachi. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Nihongo|'''Akamuji'''|赤無字}}  An Akamuji is a plain red fish that occurs normally in the breeding of Kohaku.  In Japan, this was formerly considered a fault when breeding Kohaku and most fry with this coloration were culled; but since the early 1990s has increased in popularity.  In exhibition, Akamuji are usually exhibited under the Kawarimono category, as {{Nihongo|'''Benigoi'''|紅鯉}} or as {{Nihongo|'''Hiaka'''|緋赤}}.  An Akamuji with white patches on the tips of its fins is called an {{Nihongo|'''Aka Hajiro'''|赤羽白}}.
*{{Nihongo|'''Shiromuji'''|白無字}}  A Shiromuji is a plain white fish.  This variety occur normally as part of the breeding of Kohaku and is not valued in Japan.  A similar fish, but with metallic scales {{Nihongo|Platinum koi|プラチナ鯉|Purachina-goi}} are very popular.
*{{Nihongo|'''Komoyō'''|小模様}}  In a Komoyo, the size of the markings is small (less than a quarter the length of the fish).  These fish are not highly valued.
*{{Nihongo|'''Ōmoyō'''|大模様}}  An Omoyou has large markings, at least a quarter the length of the fish.  This is desirable, because as a fish ages, the markings will separate and form interesting patterns.
*{{Nihongo|'''Dangara'''|段柄}}  Dangara refers to a pattern of well-separated markings that resemble stepping stones in a pool.  These are greatly valued in competition:
**A single stripe from head to tail is called ストライトand is not valued in Japan, but if it forms a zig-zag pattern, then this is called {{Nihongo|'''inazuma'''|稲妻}}. The name, 'inazuma', originates from the 1970 All Nippon Show, when the winner featured this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Tamadachi. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
**{{Nihongo|'''Two steps'''|二段|nidan}}  Nidan refers to a Dangara with two red patches.
**{{Nihongo|'''Three steps'''|三段|sandan}}  A Sandan has three patches.
**{{Nihongo|'''Four steps'''|四段|yondan}}.  A Yondan has four.
**A Kohaku with more than four markings must be a Komoyo, and is therefore of little value.
*{{Nihongo|'''Odome'''|尾止め}}.  This refers to the shiroji between the end of the final hi on the body and where the tail bone joins the body. This should be about 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size, although smaller or larger area of shiroji may be acceptable. The word Odome, is literally translated as the honorific form of "to stop", referring to the stop or end of the hi pattern on the koi.
*{{Nihongo|'''Zubonhaki'''|ズボン履き}}.  This refers to a hi that wraps around the tail.  This is not favoured.  In Japanese it means "to wear trousers".  The opposite fault (no hi at all near the tail) is known as "bongiri" (shirt but no trousers).
*{{Nihongo|'''Makibara'''|卷腹}}.  A hi that wraps around the belly of the fish is called "makibara."
*{{Nihongo|'''Kuchibeni'''|口紅}}.  This means "lipstick" and refers to a fish where the red covers the mouth.  This is usually considered a fault in Japan.

'''Żubroń''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|zj|uː|b|r|ən}}; {{lang-pl|Żubroń}} {{IPA-pl|ˈʐubrɔɲ|}}) is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of domestic [[cattle]] and [[wisent]]. The wisent (''żubr'' in Polish)&lt;ref&gt;PWN-Oxford Polish-English Dictionary {{ISBN|83-01-14312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the European bison; hence, the żubroń is analogous to the American [[beefalo]]. The name żubroń was officially chosen from hundreds of proposals sent to the Polish weekly magazine ''[[Przekrój]]'' during a contest organised in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.zubry.com/kazdy/zubron.html Zubry.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The żubroń was first created by Leopold Walicki in 1847, although the hybrid may also have appeared at an earlier time. After [[World War I]], various scientists considered żubroń a possible replacement for domestic [[cattle]]. Żubroń turned out to be more durable and less susceptible to disease. In addition, the animal could be bred on marginal grazing land with no farm infrastructure and with minimal [[Animal husbandry|husbandry]] in huge state agricultural farms (SAFs). From 1958, the work on żubroń herds was continued by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in various laboratories, most notably in [[Białowieża]] and [[Młodzikowo]]. During the first 16 years of experiments, a total of 71 animals were born, including ''Filon'', the first żubroń born to a żubroń mother (August 6, 1960). The animal was intended to become a hardy and cheap alternative to cattle.

The experiment was continued until the late 1980s, when the results of the breeding programmes were deemed unsatisfactory. Various factors contributed to this decision, including the severe economic difficulties of the Polish [[socialist economy]] in the 1980s, a lack of interest from the notoriously ineffective SAFs, and fears that żubroń would [[crossbreed]] with the endangered wild wisent, [[genetic pollution|contaminating]] their [[gene pool]]. The two notable centres for experiments on the species were [[Łękno]] (391 animals altogether) and [[Popielno]] (121 animals), while limited experiments were also held in the reserve of [[Askania Nova]] in the [[USSR]]. This was discontinued, and the sole surviving herd consists of several animals only, kept at [[Białowieża Forest|Bialowieski National Park]]. As of 2007, however, there are press releases suggesting the breeding and experiments are continuing in [[Karolew, Greater Poland Voivodeship|Karolew]] in [[Greater Poland]].&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite news |author=ag |title=Żubr wyrzucony z Bieszczadów za przyjaźń z ludźmi |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,53600,3965383.html |work=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |publisher=Agora SA | date=2007-03-05 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Żubroń are heavy animals, with males weighing up to {{Convert|1200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females up to {{Convert|810|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They are strong, resistant to disease, and tolerant of harsh weather conditions. The first-cross calves have to be born by [[Caesarean section]], because although they may be carried successfully to full term, [[parturition]] never occurs. Males are [[infertility|infertile]] in the first generation. &lt;!--original said their direct descendants breed normally - but infertile males cannot have direct descendants --&gt; Females are fertile and can be crossbred with either parent species, i.e. with cattle or wisent, and males from these backcrosses are fertile.

The Faroe pony ({{lang-fo|føroyska rossið}}) is a small but strong pony. Its height is between {{convert|115-125|cm}}. In the old days it was used as a work horse, carrying heavy loads, but now it’s mostly used as a child’s riding horse. In the early 1900, a lot of ponies were exported to be used as pit ponies. In the 1960s, there were 5-6 pure ponies left; now, with huge effort, there are 73 ponies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/faeroes/index.htm Faroese pony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611071848/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/faeroes/index.htm |date=2009-06-11 }} Cit. 15-10-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Faroe sheep]] is a small and hardy breed. It is one of the [[Northern European short-tailed sheep]] and has been on the islands for over 1000 years. The sheep is a huge part of Faroese culture - it is a part of the local cuisine, and might have given the islands their name; ''Føroyar'', the name of the Faroes, is thought to mean "sheep islands." There used to be another sheep breed on the islands, the [[Lítla Dímun sheep]] or ''Dímunarseyðurin'', that was smaller and more goat-like in appearance. It lived a feral existence on the island of [[Lítla Dímun]], but all specimens of this breed were shot in the [[19th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/faeroes/index.htm |title=Faeroes |work=ansi.okstate.edu |publisher=Oklahoma State University Dept. of Animal Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608023627/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/faeroes/index.htm |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hybrid camel''' is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a [[Bactrian camel]] (''Camelus bactrianus'') and [[dromedary]] (''Camelus dromedarius'').

== Names ==
Hybrid camels have different names depending on zone and language. Some names include:
* Turkoman
* Tülu
* Bukht
* Nar
* Iner
* Iver
* Majen
* Bertuar
* Yaml
* Dromano
* Dromel

=== Tülu ===
A '''Tülu Camel''' is a breed of camel that results from mating a male [[Bactrian camel]] with a female [[Dromedary]].  This breed is sometimes called an '''F1 Hybrid Camel'''.  The resulting camel is larger than either a Bactrian or a Dromedary, and has traditionally been used as a draft animal.  This breed of camel is also the breed used in the sport of [[Camel wrestling]].

Tülu Camels have one large hump instead of two or one smaller ones.

==Classification==
Generally a ''Camelus bactrianus'' × ''Camelus dromedarius'' hybrid is called an [[F1 hybrid|F1]]. It usually has a single large hump, sometimes slightly divided, and is larger than both parents, reaching 230&amp;nbsp;cm at the shoulder and up to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg. This type of camel is extremely strong and is useful for hard work such as [[plowing]] and carrying loads. It was also used in war by the Ottoman Turks. It is generally docile and tame. It is fertile.

Pure camel hybrids are mostly found in [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Turkey]]; but they can be found in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] as well.

The F1 can be further hybridized. An F1 female can mate with a male Bactrian camel: the result is a B1 backcross Bactrian. It generally has two humps and is faster than a common Bactrian and stronger than a dromedary. It can walk over [[snow]], [[ice]], and [[mud]] and is suitable even for mountain trails; this type can be found mostly in Kazakhstan.

When an F1 female mates with a dromedary, the result is an B1 backcross dromedary, a slightly stronger dromedary and a rare type nowadays.

'''Cattle'''—colloquially '''cows'''—are the most common type of large [[domestication|domesticated]] [[ungulate]]s. They are a prominent modern member of the [[subfamily]] [[Bovinae]], are the most widespread [[species]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Bos]]'', and are most commonly classified collectively as '''''Bos taurus'''''.

Cattle are commonly raised as [[livestock]] for meat ([[beef]] or [[veal]], see [[beef cattle]]), for [[milk]] (see [[dairy cattle]]), and for [[hide (skin)|hides]], which are used to make [[leather]]. They are used as [[riding animal]]s and [[draft animal]]s ([[ox]]en or [[wikt:bullock|bullocks]], which pull [[cart]]s, [[plow]]s and other implements).

Cattle were originally identified as three separate species: ''Bos taurus'', the [[taurine cattle|European or "taurine" cattle]] (including similar types from Africa and Asia); ''Bos indicus'', the [[zebu]]; and the extinct ''Bos primigenius'', the [[aurochs]]. The aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222110938_On_the_origin_of_cattle_how_aurochs_became_domestic_and_colonized_the_world |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171106/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222110938_On_the_origin_of_cattle_how_aurochs_became_domestic_and_colonized_the_world |archivedate=4 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been reclassified as one species, ''Bos taurus'', with three subspecies: ''Bos taurus primigenius'', ''Bos taurus indicus'', and ''Bos taurus taurus''.&lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3|id=14200687|heading=''Bos taurus''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS|ID=183838|taxon=''Bos taurus''|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to [[interbreed]] with other closely related species.

== Etymology ==

The noun ''cattle'' (which is treated as a plural and has no singular) encompasses both sexes. The singular, ''cow'', technically means the female, the male being ''bull''. The plural form ''cows'' is sometimes used colloquially to refer to both sexes collectively, as ''e.g.'' in a herd, but that usage can be misleading as the speaker's intent may indeed be just the females. The bovine species ''per se'' is clearly dimorphic.

''Cattle'' did not originate as the term for bovine animals. It was borrowed from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] {{lang|xno|catel}}, itself from medieval Latin {{lang|la|capitale}} 'principal sum of money, capital', itself derived in turn from Latin {{lang|la|caput}} 'head'. ''Cattle'' originally meant movable [[personal property]], especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to [[real property]] (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens — they were sold as part of the land).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cattle |title=Cattle |accessdate=13 June 2007 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |year=2001 |work=Online Etymological Dictionary |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011182356/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=cattle |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}; "cattle, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2014. Web. 6 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a variant of ''[[Personal property|chattel]]'' (a unit of personal property) and closely related to ''[[capital (economics)|capital]]'' in the economic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chattel |title=Chattel |accessdate=13 June 2007 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |year=2001 |work=Online Etymological Dictionary |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011182401/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=chattel |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}; {{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=capital |title=Capital |accessdate=13 June 2007 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |year=2001 |work=Online Etymological Dictionary |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011182517/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=capital |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}; "cattle, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2014. Web. 6 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term replaced earlier [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|feoh}} 'cattle, property', which survives today as ''fee'' (cf. {{Lang-de|link=no|Vieh}}, {{Lang-nl|vee}}, {{Lang-got|faihu}}).

The word "cow" came via [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] {{lang|ang|cū}} (plural ''cȳ''), from [[Common Indo-European]] {{PIE|''gʷōus''}} ([[genitive]] {{PIE|''gʷowés''}}) = "a bovine animal", compare {{lang-fa|gâv|script=Latn}}, {{lang-sa|go-|script=Latn}}, {{lang-cy|buwch}}.&lt;ref&gt;"cow, n.1." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2014. Web. 6 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The plural ''cȳ'' became ''ki'' or ''kie'' in Middle English, and an additional plural ending was often added, giving ''kine'', ''kien'', but also ''kies'', ''kuin'' and others. This is the origin of the now archaic English plural, "kine". The [[Scots language]] singular is coo or [[:sco:Cou|cou]], and the plural is "kye".

In older English sources such as the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, "cattle" refers to livestock, as opposed to "deer" which refers to wildlife.  "Wild cattle" may refer to [[Feral organism|feral]] cattle or to undomesticated species of the genus ''[[Bos]]''.  Today, when used without any other qualifier, the modern meaning of "cattle" is usually restricted to domesticated bovines.&lt;ref&gt;"cattle, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2014.

=== Singular terminology issue ===
"Cattle" can only be used in the [[plural]] and not in the [[Grammatical number|singular]]: it is a [[plurale tantum]].&lt;ref name=OED1&gt;{{OED|Cattle (5, 6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one may refer to "three cattle" or "some cattle", but not "one cattle". No universally used singular form in modern English of ''cattle'' exists, other than the sex- and age-specific terms such as cow, bull, steer and heifer.  Historically, "ox" was not a sex-specific term for adult cattle, but generally this is now used only for [[Ox|working cattle]], especially adult castrated males. The term is also incorporated into the names of other species, such as the [[musk ox]] and "grunting ox" ([[yak]]), and is used in some areas to describe certain cattle products such as ox-hide and [[oxtail]].&lt;ref name=OED2&gt;{{OED|Ox (1, 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brahman Baby.jpg|thumb|A [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]] calf]]
''Cow'' is in general use as a singular for the collective ''cattle.'' The word ''cow'' is easy to use when a singular is needed and the sex is unknown or irrelevant – when "there is a cow in the road", for example. Further, any herd of fully mature cattle in or near a [[pasture]] is statistically likely to consist mostly of cows, so the term is probably accurate even in the restrictive sense.  Other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated as calves and are used as [[ox]]en or slaughtered for meat before the age of three years.  Thus, in a pastured herd, any calves or herd bulls usually are clearly distinguishable from the cows due to distinctively different sizes and clear anatomical differences. Merriam-Webster and Oxford Living Dictionaries recognize the sex-nonspecific use of ''cow'' as an alternate definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cow |title=Merriam Webster Online |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015042256/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cow |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cow|title=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Collins and the OED do not.

[[Colloquial]]ly, more general non[[species|specific]] terms may denote cattle when a singular form is needed. Australian, New Zealand and British farmers use the term ''beast'' or ''cattle beast''. ''Bovine'' is also used in Britain. The term ''critter'' is common in the western United States and Canada, particularly when referring to young cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/critter |title="Critter," definition 2 |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas of the American South (particularly the Appalachian region), where both dairy and beef cattle are present, an individual animal was once called a "beef critter", though that term is becoming [[Archaism|archaic]].

Cattle raised for human consumption are called ''[[beef cattle]]''.

Cows of certain breeds that are kept for the milk they give are called ''[[dairy cow]]s'' or ''milking cows'' (formerly ''milch cows'').  Most young male offspring of dairy cows are sold for [[veal]], and may be referred to as veal calves.

[[File:Скелет домашней коровы.jpg|alt=Bones are mounted on a black board|thumb|Displayed skeleton of a domestic cow]]

Cattle are large [[quadrupedal]] [[ungulate]] [[mammal]]s with [[cloven hooves]]. Most breeds have [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], which can be as large as the [[Texas Longhorn]] or small like a [[scur]]. Careful genetic selection has allowed [[polled livestock|polled]] (hornless) cattle to become widespread.
[[File:Modelo didatico bovino correto.jpg|thumb|right|Anatomy model of a cow]]

==== Digestive system ====
Cattle are [[ruminant]]s, meaning their [[Gastrointestinal_tract|digestive system]] is highly specialized to allow the use of poorly digestible plants as food. Cattle have one [[stomach]] with four compartments, the [[rumen]], [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]], [[omasum]], and [[abomasum]], with the rumen being the largest compartment.
The reticulum, the smallest compartment, is known as the "honeycomb". Cattle sometimes consume metal objects which are deposited in the reticulum and irritation from the metal objects causes [[hardware disease]]. The omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed. The omasum is known as the "many plies". The abomasum is like the human stomach; this is why it is known as the "true stomach".

Cattle are known for [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitating]] and re-chewing their food, known as [[cud]] chewing, like most ruminants.  While the animal is feeding, the food is swallowed without being chewed and goes into the rumen for storage until the animal can find a quiet place to continue the digestion process.  The food is regurgitated, a mouthful at a time, back up to the mouth, where the food, now called the [[cud]], is chewed by the molars, grinding down the coarse vegetation to small particles.  The cud is then swallowed again and further digested by specialized [[microorganism]]s in the rumen. These microbes are primarily responsible for decomposing [[cellulose]] and other [[carbohydrate]]s into [[volatile fatty acids]] cattle use as their primary [[metabolic]] fuel. The microbes inside the rumen also synthesize [[amino acid]]s from non-protein [[nitrogen]]ous sources, such as [[urea]] and [[ammonia]]. As these microbes reproduce in the rumen, older generations die and their cells continue on through the digestive tract. These cells are then partially digested in the small intestines, allowing cattle to gain a high-quality protein source. These features allow cattle to thrive on [[Poaceae|grasses]] and other tough vegetation.

==== Gestation and size ====
The [[gestation period]] for a cow is about nine months long. A newborn calf's size can vary among breeds, but a typical calf weighs between {{convert|25|to|45|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Adult size and weight vary significantly among breeds and sex. Steers are generally killed before reaching {{convert|750|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Breeding stock may be allowed a longer lifespan, occasionally living as long as 25 years. The oldest recorded cow, [[Big Bertha (cow)|Big Bertha]], died at the age of 48 in 1993.

==== Reproduction ====

[[File:Ox testis- FMVZ USP-14.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Ox testis.]]
On farms it is very common to use [[artificial insemination]] (AI),  a [[assisted reproductive technology|medically assisted reproduction technique]] consisting of the artificial deposition of [[semen]] in the [[Female Reproductive System|female's genital tract]].&lt;ref name="Hopper2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard M.

It consists of transferring, to the [[uterus|uterine cavity]], spermatozoa previously collected and processed, with the selection of morphologically more normal and mobile spermatozoa.

A cow's [[udder]] contains two pairs of [[mammary gland]]s, (commonly referred to as ''teats'') creating four "quarters".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Family Cow Handbook |last=Hasheider |first=Phillip|isbn=0-7603-4067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front ones are referred to as ''fore quarters'' and the rear ones ''rear quarters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.uvm.edu/extension/agriculture/faccp/files/aglabor_bilingual/milk_quality_posters.pdf |title=Udder Structure &amp; Disease |date=2015-05-06|website=UVM|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073505/https://www.uvm.edu/extension/agriculture/faccp/files/aglabor_bilingual/milk_quality_posters.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Bull#Reproductive anatomy}}
Bulls become fertile at about seven months of age.  Their fertility is closely related to the size of their [[testicle]]s, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum: a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches {{convert|28|cm|in|0}}; that of a fully adult bull may be over {{convert|40|cm|in|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Content/File/p/Anim_Dis/747.pdf |title=G Jayawardhana (2006), ''Testicle Size – A Fertility Indicator in Bulls'', Australian Government Agnote K44. |format=PDF|accessdate=6 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116045317/http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Content/File/p/Anim_Dis/747.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/reprint/59/2/447.pdf |title=A P Carter, P D P Wood and Penelope A Wright (1980), Association between scrotal circumference, live weight and sperm output in cattle, ''Journal of Reproductive Fertility'', '''59''', pp 447–451. |format=PDF|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulls have a fibro-elastic penis. Given the small amount of erectile tissue, there is little enlargement after erection. The penis is quite rigid when non-erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the [[retractor penis muscle]] and straightening of the [[sigmoid flexure]].&lt;ref name="Sarkar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarkar |first=A. |title=Sexual Behaviour In Animals |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsCiWUiPY5UC|isbn=978-81-7141-746-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William O.

For example, to synchronise ovulation of the cattle to benefit dairy farming.

=== Weight ===
The world record for the heaviest bull was {{convert|1740|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, a [[Chianina]] named Donetto, when he was exhibited at the [[Arezzo]] show in 1955.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Friend, John B., Cattle of the World, Blandford Press, Dorset, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The heaviest steer was eight-year-old ‘Old Ben’, a [[Shorthorn]]/[[Hereford Cattle|Hereford]] cross weighing in at {{convert|2140|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} in 1910.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;McWhirter, Norris &amp; Ross, ''Guinness Book of Records'', Redwood Press, Trowbridge, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The weight of adult cattle varies, depending on the breed. Smaller kinds, such as Dexter and Jersey adults, range between {{convert|272|to|454|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1}}. Large Continental breeds, such as Charolais, Marchigiana, Belgian Blue and Chianina, adults range from {{convert|635|to|1134|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. British breeds, such as Hereford, Angus, and Shorthorn, mature between {{convert|454|to|907|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1}}, occasionally higher, particularly with Angus and Hereford.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cattlenetwork.net/breeds/hereford.htm|title=Hereford cattle weight|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124050154/http://www.cattlenetwork.net/breeds/hereford.htm|archivedate=24 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulls will be a bit larger than cows of the same breed by a few hundred kilograms. Chianina bulls can weigh up to  {{convert|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; British bulls, such as Angus and Hereford, can weigh as little as {{convert|907|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to as much as {{convert|1361|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

It is difficult to generalize or average out the weight of all cattle because different kinds have different averages of weights. However, according to some sources, the average weight of all cattle is {{convert|753|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  Finishing steers in the feedlot average about {{convert|640|kg|lb|abbr=on}}; cows about {{convert|725|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1}}, and bulls about {{convert|1090|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ilri/x5522e/x5522e0b.htm |title=FAO Cattle Weights|accessdate=2015-05-05 |website=FAO|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421014047/http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ilri/x5522e/x5522e0b.htm |archivedate=21 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the average weight of beef cattle has steadily increased, especially since the 1970s, requiring the building of new slaughterhouses able to handle larger carcasses. New packing plants in the 1980s stimulated a large increase in cattle weights.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth H. Mathews – 1999 – U.S. Beef Industry: Cattle Cycles, Price Spreads, and Packer concentration.

== Cognition ==
In laboratory studies, young cattle are able to memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8&amp;nbsp;hours, although this declined after 12&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="Bailey1989"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=23 |issue=4 |year=1989 |pages=331–340 |title=Characteristics of spatial memory in cattle |last1=Bailey |first1=D.W. |last2=Rittenhouse |first2=L.R. |last3=Hart |first3=R.H. |last4=Richards |first4=R.W |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(89)90101-9|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258397 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their longer-term memory is less stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kovalčik |first1=K. |last2=Kovalčik |first2=M. |year=1986 |title=Learning ability and memory testing in cattle of different ages |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=27–29 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(86)90019-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks and have a good long-term memory in these tests.  Cattle tested in a [[radial arm maze]] are able to remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days.  Although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration.&lt;ref name="Mendl2009first"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendl |first1=M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |chapter=Chapter 5: Learning and cognition |pages=61–63 |editor1-last=Jensen |editor1-first=P. |year=2009 |title=The Ethology of Domestic Animals: An Introductory Text |publisher=CABI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under less artificial testing conditions, young cattle showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ksiksi |first1=T. |last2=Laca |first2=E.A. |year=2002 |title=Cattle do remember locations of preferred food over extended periods |journal=Asian Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=900–904 |doi=10.5713/ajas.2002.900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day – memory of this association can be retained for 1 year, despite a slight decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hirata |first1=M. |last2=Takeno |first2=N. |year=2014 |title=Do cattle (Bos taurus) retain an association of a visual cue with a food reward for a year? |journal=Animal Science Journal |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=729–734 |doi=10.1111/asj.12210|pmid=24798642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also able to discriminate between familiar individuals, and among humans.  Cattle can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar animals of the same species (conspecifics).  Studies show they behave less aggressively toward familiar individuals when they are forming a new group.&lt;ref name="Coulon2011" /&gt;  Calves can also discriminate between humans based on previous experience, as shown by approaching those who handled them positively and avoiding those who handled them aversively.&lt;ref name="Passille1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Passille |first1=A.M. |last2=Rushen |first2=J. |last3=Ladewig |first3=J. |last4=Petherick |first4=C. |title=Dairy calves' discrimination of people based on previous handling |year=1996 |volume=74 |pages=969–974 |journal=Journal of Animal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cattle can discriminate between humans by their faces alone, they also use other cues such as the color of clothes when these are available.&lt;ref name="Mendl2009second"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendl |first1=M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |chapter=Chapter 5: Learning and cognition |pages=144 |editor1-last=Jensen |editor1-first=P. |year=2009 |title=The Ethology of Domestic Animals: An Introductory Text |publisher=CABI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When mixed with other individuals, [[Cloning|cloned]] calves from the same donor form subgroups, indicating that kin discrimination occurs and may be a basis of grouping behaviour.  It has also been shown using images of cattle that both artificially inseminated and cloned calves have similar cognitive capacities of kin and non-kin discrimination.&lt;ref name="Coulon2010x"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coulon |first1=M. |last2=Baudoin |first2=C. |last3=Abdi |first3=H. |last4=Heyman |first4=Y. |last5=Deputte |first5=B.L. |year=2010 |title=Social behavior and kin discrimination in a mixed group of cloned and non cloned heifers (Bos taurus) |journal=Theriogenology |volume=74 |issue=9 |pages=1596–1603 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X10003493 |doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.06.031|pmid=20708240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle can recognize familiar individuals. Visual individual recognition is a more complex mental process than visual discrimination.

Furthermore, almost all the heifers recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, although this was achieved with greater difficulty.  Individual recognition was most difficult when the visual features of the breed being tested were quite different from the breed in the image, for example, the breed being tested had no spots whereas the image was of a spotted breed.&lt;ref name="Coulon2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coulon |first1=M. |last2=Deputte |first2=B.L. |last3=Heyman |first3=Y. |last4=Baudoin |first4=C. |year=2009 |title=Individual recognition in domestic cattle (Bos taurus): evidence from 2D-images of heads from different breeds |journal=PLOS One |volume=4 |issue= 2|pages=4441 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004441 |pmid=19212439 |pmc=2636880 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.4441C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cattle, temperament can affect production traits such as carcass and meat quality or milk yield as well as affecting the animal's overall health and reproduction. Cattle temperament is defined as "the consistent behavioral and physiological difference observed between individuals in response to a stressor or environmental challenge and is used to describe the relatively stable difference in the behavioral predisposition of an animal, which can be related to psychobiological mechanisms".&lt;ref name="Brand2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brand, B. |author2=Hadlich, F. |author3=Brandt, B. |author4=Schauer, N. |author5=Graunke, K.L. |author6=Langbein, J. |author7=... and Schwerin, M. |year=2015 |title=Temperament type specific metabolite profiles of the prefrontal cortex and serum in cattle. |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125044 |journal=PLOS One |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=e0125044 |pmid=25927228 |pmc=4416037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, cattle temperament is assumed to be multidimensional.

In a study on Holstein–Friesian heifers learning to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward, the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food. When the heifers made clear improvements in learning, they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race. The researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement.&lt;ref name="Hagen"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2004 |title=Emotional reactions to learning in cattle |volume=85 |issue=3–4 |pages=203–213 |author1=Hagen, K. |author2=Broom, D. |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591%2803%2900294-6/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2003.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative emotional states are associated with a bias toward negative (pessimistic) responses towards ambiguous cues in judgement tasks – as encapsulated in the question of [[Cognitive bias|"is the glass half empty or half full?"]].  After separation from their mothers, Holstein calves showed such a cognitive bias indicative of low mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daros |first1=R.R. |last2=Costa |first2=J.H. |last3=von Keyserlingk |first3=M.A. |last4=Hötzel |first4=M.J. |last5=Weary |first5=D.M. |year=2014 |title=Separation from the dam causes negative judgement bias in dairy calves |journal=PLOS One |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=e98429 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0098429 |pmid=24848635 |pmc=4029834|bibcode=2014PLoSO...998429D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar study showed that after hot-iron disbudding ([[dehorning]]), calves had a similar negative bias indicating that post-operative pain following this routine procedure results in a negative change in emotional state.&lt;ref name="Neave"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neave |first1=H.W. |last2=Daros |first2=R.R. |last3=Costa |first3=J.H.C. |last4=von Keyserlingk |first4=M.A.G. |last5=Weary |first5=D.M. |year=2013 |title=Pain and pessimism: Dairy calves exhibit negative judgement bias following hot-iron disbudding |journal=PLOS One |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=e80556 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0080556 |pmid=24324609 |pmc=3851165|bibcode=2013PLoSO...880556N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of visual discrimination, the position of the ears has been used as an indicator of emotional state.&lt;ref name="Coulon2011" /&gt; When cattle are stressed other cattle can tell by the chemicals released in their urine.&lt;ref name="Boissy1998" /&gt;

Cattle are very [[Social animal|gregarious]] and even short-term isolation is considered to cause severe psychological [[Stress (biology)|stress]].  When [[Aubrac (cattle)|Aubrac]] and Friesian heifers are isolated, they increase their vocalizations and experience increased [[heart rate]] and plasma [[cortisol]] concentrations.  These physiological changes are greater in Aubracs.  When visual contact is re-instated, vocalisations rapidly decline, regardless of the familiarity of the returning cattle, however, heart rate decreases are greater if the returning cattle are familiar to the previously-isolated individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boissy, A. |author2=Le Neindre, P. |year=1997 |title=Behavioral, cardiac and cortisol responses to brief peer separation and reunion in cattle |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=693–699 |doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(96)00521-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mirrors have been used to reduce stress in isolated cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kay, R. |author2=Hall, C. |year=2009 |title=The use of a mirror reduces isolation stress in horses being transported by trailer. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=237–243 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2008.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Senses ==
Cattle use all of the five widely recognized sensory modalities.  These can assist in some complex behavioural patterns, for example, in grazing behaviour.  Cattle eat mixed diets, but when given the opportunity, show a partial preference of approximately 70% clover and 30% grass. This preference has a diurnal pattern, with a stronger preference for clover in the morning, and the proportion of grass increasing towards the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rutter, S.M. |year=2006 |title=Diet preference for grass and legumes in free-ranging domestic sheep and cattle: current theory and future application. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=17–35 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vision ===
Vision is the dominant sense in cattle and they obtain almost 50% of their information visually.
&lt;ref name="Adamczyk"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adamczyk, K. |author2=Górecka-Bruzda, A. |author3=Nowicki, J. |author4=Gumułka, M. |author5=Molik, E. |author6=Schwarz, T. |author7=Klocek, C. |title=Perception of environment in farm animals – A review |journal=Annals of Animal Science |year=2015 |doi=10.1515/aoas-2015-0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle are a prey animal and to assist predator detection, their eyes are located on the sides of their head rather than the front.  This gives them a wide field of view of 330° but limits [[binocular vision]] (and therefore [[stereopsis]]) to 30° to 50° compared to 140° in humans.&lt;ref name="Coulon2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Phillips, C. |year=2008 |title=Cattle Behaviour and Welfare. |publisher=John Wiley and Sons.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means they have a blind spot directly behind them.  Cattle have good visual acuity (1/20)&lt;ref name="Coulon2011" /&gt; but compared to humans, the visual accommodation of cattle is poor.&lt;ref name="Adamczyk" /&gt;

Cattle have two kinds of [[color receptors]] in the [[cone cells]] of their [[retina]]s.   This means that cattle are [[Dichromacy|dichromatic]], as are most other non-primate land mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacobs |first1=G.H. |last2=Deegan |first2=J.F. |last3=Neitz |first3=J. |year=1998 |title=Photopigment basis for dichromatic color vision in cows, goats and sheep |journal=Vis.

Calves are able to discriminate between long (red) and short (blue) or medium (green) wavelengths, but have limited ability to discriminate between the short and medium.  They also approach handlers more quickly under red light.&lt;ref name="Phillips2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Phillips, C.J.C. |author2=Lomas, C.A. |year=2001 |title=The perception of color by cattle and its influence on behavior |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=807–813 |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(01)74537-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst having good color sensitivity, it is not as good as humans or sheep.&lt;ref name="Coulon2011" /&gt;

A common misconception about cattle (particularly bulls) is that they are enraged by the color red (something provocative is often said to be "like a red flag to a bull"). This is a myth. In [[bullfighting]], it is the movement of the red flag or cape that irritates the bull and incites it to charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/33700-bulls-charge-red.html |title=Why Do Bulls Charge When they See Red? |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518105254/http://www.livescience.com/33700-bulls-charge-red.html |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taste ===
Cattle have a well-developed sense of taste and can distinguish the four primary tastes (sweet, salty, bitter and sour). They possess around 20,000 taste buds. The strength of taste perception depends on the individual's current food requirements. They avoid bitter-tasting foods (potentially toxic) and have a marked preference for sweet (high calorific value) and salty foods ([[electrolyte]] balance).  Their sensitivity to sour-tasting foods helps them to maintain optimal ruminal [[pH]].&lt;ref name="Adamczyk" /&gt;

Plants have low levels of sodium and cattle have developed the capacity of seeking salt by taste and smell.  If cattle become depleted of sodium salts, they show increased locomotion directed to searching for these.  To assist in their search, the olfactory and gustatory receptors able to detect minute amounts of sodium salts increase their sensitivity as biochemical disruption develops with sodium salt depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bell, F.R. |author2=Sly, J. |year=1983 |title=The olfactory detection of sodium and lithium salts by sodium deficient cattle. |journal=Physiology and Behavior |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=307–312 |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(83)90193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, F. R. |year=1984 |title=Aspects of ingestive behavior in cattle |journal=Journal of Animal Science |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=1369–1372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audition ===
Cattle hearing ranges from 23 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 35&amp;nbsp;kHz.  Their frequency of best sensitivity is 8&amp;nbsp;kHz and they have a lowest threshold of −21 [[Decibel|db]] (re 20 μN/m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), which means their hearing is more acute than horses (lowest threshold of 7 db).&lt;ref name="Heffner"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Heffner, R.S. |author2=Heffner, H.E. |year=1983 |title=Hearing in large mammals: Horses (Equus caballus) and cattle (Bos taurus) |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=299–309 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0735-7044.97.2.299 |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.97.2.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound localization acuity thresholds are an average of 30°.  This means that cattle are less able to localise sounds compared to goats (18°), dogs (8°) and humans (0.8°).&lt;ref name="Heffner1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Heffner, R.S. |author2=Heffner, H.E. |year=1992 |title=Hearing in large mammals: sound-localization acuity in cattle (Bos taurus) and goats (Capra hircus) |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=107–113 |doi=10.1037/0735-7036.106.2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because cattle have a broad foveal fields of view covering almost the entire horizon, they may not need very accurate locus information from their auditory systems to direct their gaze to a sound source.

Vocalisations are an important mode of communication amongst cattle and can provide information on the age, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of the caller. Calves can recognize their mothers using vocalizations; vocal behaviour may play a role by indicating estrus and competitive display by bulls.&lt;ref name="Watts2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Watts, J.M. |author2=Stookey, J.M. |year=2000 |title=Vocal behaviour in cattle: the animal's commentary on its biological processes and welfare |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=15–33 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(99)00108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfaction and gustation ===
[[File:New born Frisian red white calf.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Several senses are used in social relationships between cattle]]
Cattle have a range of odiferous glands over their body including [[interdigital]], [[infraorbital salivary gland|infraorbital]], [[wikt:inguinal|inguinal]] and [[sebaceous]] glands, indicating that olfaction probably plays a large role in their social life.  Both the primary olfactory system using the [[olfactory bulb]]s, and the secondary olfactory system using the [[vomeronasal organ]] are used.&lt;ref name="Keeling"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Keeling|editor-first1=L.|editor-last2=Gonyou|editor-first2=H. |year=2001 |chapter=The Social Behaviour of Cattle 5. |title=Social Behavior in Farm Animals |last1=Bouissou |first1=M.F. |last2=Boissy |first2=A. |last3=Le Niendre |first3=P. |last4=Vessier |first4=I. |publisher=CABI Publishing |pages=113–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This latter olfactory system is used in the [[flehmen]] response.  There is evidence that when cattle are stressed, this can be recognised by other cattle and this is communicated by alarm substances in the urine.&lt;ref name="Boissy1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boissy |first1=A. |last2=Terlouw |first2=C. |last3=Le Neindre |first3=P. |year=1998 |title=Presence of cues from stressed conspecifics increases reactivity to aversive events in cattle: evidence for the existence of alarm substances in urine |journal=Physiology and Behavior |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=489–495 |doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(97)00466-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The odour of dog faeces induces behavioural changes prior to cattle feeding, whereas the odours of urine from either stressed or non-stressed conspecifics and blood have no effect.&lt;ref name="Terlouw1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Terlouw |first1=E.C. |last2=Boissy |first2=A. |last3=Blinet |first3=P. |year=1998 |title=Behavioural responses of cattle to the odours of blood and urine from conspecifics and to the odour of faeces from carnivores. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(97)00122-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, cattle can be trained to recognise conspecific individuals using olfaction only.&lt;ref name="Keeling" /&gt;

In general, cattle use their sense of smell to "expand" on information detected by other sensory modalities.  However, in the case of social and reproductive behaviours, olfaction is a key source of information.&lt;ref name="Adamczyk" /&gt;

=== Touch ===
Cattle have tactile sensations detected mainly by [[mechanoreceptor]]s, [[thermoreceptor]]s and [[nociceptor]]s in the skin and muzzle.  These are used most frequently when cattle explore their environment.&lt;ref name="Adamczyk" /&gt;

=== Magnetoreception ===
There is conflicting evidence for [[magnetoreception]] in cattle. One study reported that resting and grazing cattle tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic North-South (N-S) direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Begall |first1=S. |last2=Cerveny |first2=J. |last3=Neef |first3=J. |last4=Vojtech |first4=O. |last5=Burda |first5=H. |year=2008 |title=Magnetic alignment in grazing and resting cattle and deer|journal=Proc.

== Behavior ==
Under natural conditions, calves stay with their mother until weaning at 8 to 11 months.  Heifer and bull calves are equally attached to their mothers in the first few months of life.&lt;ref name="Johnsen2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnsen |first1=J.F. |last2=Ellingsen |first2=K. |last3=Grøndahl |first3=A.M. |last4=Bøe |first4=K.E. |last5=Lidfors |first5=L. |last6=Mejdell |first6=C.M. |year=2015 |title=The effect of physical contact between dairy cows and calves during separation on their post-separation behavioural |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie_Johnsen/publication/274013035_The_effect_of_physical_contact_between_dairy_cows_and_calves_during_separation_on_their_post-separation_behavioural_response/links/551541630cf2d70ee26fee97.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.03.002 |volume=166 |pages=11–19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707160417/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie_Johnsen/publication/274013035_The_effect_of_physical_contact_between_dairy_cows_and_calves_during_separation_on_their_post-separation_behavioural_response/links/551541630cf2d70ee26fee97.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;!--IN PRESS Needs updating--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Cattle are considered to be "hider" type animals, but in the artificial environment of small calving pens, close proximity between cow and calf is maintained by the mother at the first three calvings but this changes to being mediated by the calf after these.

[[File:Calf suckling at a meadow near Vrachesh, Bulgaria.webm|thumb|Video of a calf suckling]]
Beef-calves reared on the range suckle an average of 5.0 times every 24&amp;nbsp;hours with an average total time of 46&amp;nbsp;min spent suckling. There is a diurnal rhythm in suckling activity with peaks between 05:00–07:00, 10:00–13:00 and 17:00–21:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odde |first1=K.

Studies on the natural weaning of zebu cattle (''Bos indicus'') have shown that the cow weans her calves over a 2-week period, but after that, she continues to show strong affiliatory behavior with her offspring and preferentially chooses them for grooming and as grazing partners for at least 4–5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reinhardt |first1=V. |last2=Reinhardt |first2=A. |year=1981 |title=Cohesive relationships in a cattle herd (Bos indicus) |journal=Behaviour |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=121–150 |doi=10.1163/156853981X00194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive behavior ===
[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|alt=Nine sequential photos showing the calf being born|thumb|A cow giving birth]]

Semi-wild [[Highland cattle]] heifers first give birth at 2 or 3 years of age, and the timing of birth is synchronized with increases in natural food quality. Average calving interval is 391&amp;nbsp;days, and calving mortality within the first year of life is 5%.&lt;ref name="Reinhardt1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reinhardt |first1=C. |last2=Reinhardt |first2=A. |last3=Reinhardt |first3=V. |year=1986 |title=Social behaviour and reproductive performance in semi-wild Scottish Highland cattle |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(86)90058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominance and leadership ===
One study showed that over a 4-year period, dominance relationships within a herd of semi-wild highland cattle were very firm. There were few overt aggressive conflicts and the majority of disputes were settled by [[agonistic behavior|agonistic]] (non-aggressive, competitive) behaviors that involved no physical contact between opponents (e.g. threatening and spontaneous withdrawing).  Such agonistic behavior reduces the risk of injury. Dominance status depended on age and sex, with older animals generally being dominant to young ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls gained superior dominance status over adult cows when they reached about 2 years of age.&lt;ref name="Reinhardt1986" /&gt;

As with many animal dominance hierarchies, dominance-associated aggressiveness does not correlate with rank position, but is closely related to rank distance between individuals.&lt;ref name="Reinhardt1986" /&gt;

Dominance is maintained in several ways.  Cattle often engage in mock fights where they test each other's strength in a non-aggressive way.  Licking is primarily performed by subordinates and received by dominant animals.  Mounting is a playful behavior shown by calves of both sexes and by bulls and sometimes by cows in estrus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extension.psu.edu/animals/dairy/health/reproduction/insemination/ec402/signs-of-heat |title=Signs of Heat (Heat Detection and Timing of Insemination for Cattle) |website=Heat Detection and Timing of Insemination for Cattle (Penn State Extension) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105161839/http://extension.psu.edu/animals/dairy/health/reproduction/insemination/ec402/signs-of-heat |archivedate=5 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is not a dominance related behavior as has been found in other species.&lt;ref name="Reinhardt1986" /&gt;

The horns of cattle are "[[honest signals]]" used in mate selection.  Furthermore, horned cattle attempt to keep greater distances between themselves and have fewer physical interactions than hornless cattle.  This leads to more stable social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knierim |first1=U. |last2=Irrgang |first2=N. |last3=Roth |first3=B.A. |year=2015 |title=To be or not to be horned–consequences in cattle |journal=Livestock Science |doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2015.05.014 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141315002437 |volume=179 |pages=29–37}}&lt;!-- IN PRESS NEEDS UPDATING.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In calves, the frequency of agonistic behavior decreases as space allowance increases, but this does not occur for changes in group size. However, in adult cattle, the number of agonistic encounters increases as the group size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kondo |first1=S. |last2=Sekine |first2=J. |last3=Okubo |first3=M. |last4=Asahida |first4=Y. |year=1989 |title=The effect of group size and space allowance on the agonistic and spacing behavior of cattle. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=127–135 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(89)90040-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grazing behavior ===
When grazing, cattle vary several aspects of their bite, i.e. tongue and jaw movements, depending on characteristics of the plant they are eating.  Bite area decreases with the density of the plants but increases with their height.  Bite area is determined by the sweep of the tongue; in one study observing {{convert|750|kg|adj=on}} steers, bite area reached a maximum of approximately {{convert|170|cm2|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.  Bite depth increases with the height of the plants.  By adjusting their behavior, cattle obtain heavier bites in swards that are tall and sparse compared with short, dense swards of equal mass/area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laca |first1=E.A. |last2=Ungar |first2=E.D. |last3=Seligman |first3=N. |last4=Demment |first4=M.W. |year=1992 |title=Effects of sward height and bulk density on bite dimensions of cattle grazing homogeneous swards |journal=Grass and Forage Science |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=91–102 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2494.1992.tb02251.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cattle adjust other aspects of their grazing behavior in relation to the available food; foraging velocity decreases and intake rate increases in areas of abundant palatable forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bailey |first1=D.W. |last2=Gross |first2=J.E. |last3=Laca |first3=E.A. |last4=Rittenhouse |first4=L.R. |last5=Coughenour |first5=M.B. |last6=Swift |first6=D.M. |last7=Sims |first7=P.L. |year=1996 |title=Mechanisms that result in large herbivore grazing distribution patterns |journal=Journal of Range Management |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=386–400 |doi=10.2307/4002919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle avoid grazing areas contaminated by the faeces of other cattle more strongly than they avoid areas contaminated by sheep,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forbes |first1=T.D.A. |last2=Hodgson |first2=J. |year=1985 |title=The reaction of grazing sheep and cattle to the presence of dung from the same or the other species |journal=Grass and Forage Science |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=177–182 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2494.1985.tb01735.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they do not avoid pasture contaminated by rabbit faeces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daniels |first1=M.J. |last2=Ball |first2=N. |last3=Hutchings |first3=M.R. |last4=Greig |first4=A. |year=2001 |title=The grazing response of cattle to pasture contaminated with rabbit faeces and the implications for the transmission of paratuberculosis |journal=The Veterinary Journal |volume=161 |issue=3 |pages=306–313 |doi=10.1053/tvjl.2000.0550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domestication and husbandry ==
[[File:Texas Longhorn.jpg|thumb|[[Texas Longhorn]]s are a US breed]]
Cattle occupy a unique role in [[History of the world|human history]], having been domesticated since at least the early [[neolithic]] age.

Archeozoological and genetic data indicate that cattle were first domesticated from wild [[aurochs]] (''Bos primigenius'') approximately 10,500 years ago. There were two major areas of domestication: one in the area that is now Turkey, giving rise to the taurine line, and a second in the area that is now Pakistan, resulting in the indicine line.&lt;ref name="McTavish"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McTavish |first1=E.J. |last2=Decker |first2=J.E. |last3=Schnabel |first3=R.D. |last4=Taylor |first4=J.F. |last5=Hillis |first5=D.M.year=2013 |title=New World cattle show ancestry from multiple independent domestication events |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=110 |issue=15 |pages=E1398–406 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1303367110 |pmid=23530234 |pmc=3625352|year=2013 |bibcode=2013PNAS..110E1398M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern mitochondrial DNA variation indicates the taurine line may have arisen from as few as 80 [[aurochs]] tamed in the upper reaches of [[Mesopotamia]] near the villages of [[Çayönü Tepesi]] in southeastern Turkey and [[Dja'de el-Mughara]] in northern [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="HowNowCow" /&gt;

Although European cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage, gene flow from African cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern European cattle breeds and their New World descendants.&lt;ref name="McTavish" /&gt;  A study on 134 breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and Europe.&lt;ref name="Decker"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Decker |first1=J.E. |last2=McKay |first2=S.D. |last3=Rolf |first3=M.M. |last4=Kim |first4=J. |last5=Molina Alcalá |first5=A. |last6=Sonstegard |first6=T.S. |year=2014 |title=Worldwide patterns of ancestry, divergence, and admixture in domesticated cattle. |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=e1004254 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004254 |url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004254 |display-authors=etal |pmid=24675901 |pmc=3967955 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401010310/http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004254 |archivedate=1 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers have suggested that African taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from North African aurochsen.&lt;ref name="McTavish" /&gt;

=== Usage as money ===
As early as 9000 BC both grain and cattle were used as money or as ''barter'' (Davies) (the ''[[Ohalo|first grain remains]]'' found, considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gustavo A Slafer|author2=Jose Luis Molina-Cano|author3=Roxana Savin|author4=Jose Luis Araus|author5=Ignacio Romagosa|title=Barley Science: Recent Advances from Molecular Biology to Agronomy of Yield and Quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awQqSujTR1MC|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-56022-910-0|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Glyn Davies|author2=Julian Hodge Bank|title=A history of money: from ancient times to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx68AAAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-1717-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Soto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jesús Huerta de Soto|title=Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJLGKdOZneMC&amp;pg=PA51|year=2006|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=978-1-61016-388-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals, such as [[camels]] and [[goats]], may have been used as currency in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hostmerchantservices.com/articles/financial-news-articles/the-history-of-currency-from-bartering-to-the-credit-card/ |title=A History of Money|accessdate=19 May 2015|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521084634/https://www.hostmerchantservices.com/articles/financial-news-articles/the-history-of-currency-from-bartering-to-the-credit-card/ |archivedate=21 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advantages of using cattle as currency is that it allows the seller to set a fixed price. It even created the standard pricing. For example, two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens.&lt;ref name="Davies2002" /&gt;

=== Modern husbandry ===
[[File:Cattle inspected for ticks.jpg|thumb|This Hereford is being inspected for [[tick]]s; cattle are often restrained or confined in [[cattle crush]]es (squeeze chutes) when given medical attention.]]
[[File:Anneau anti tetee P1190486.jpg|thumb|This young bovine has a [[Nose ring (animal)|nose ring]] to prevent it from suckling, which is usually to assist in [[weaning]].]]

Cattle are often raised by allowing herds to [[Grass fed beef|graze on the grasses]] of large tracts of [[rangeland]]. Raising cattle in this manner allows the use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. The most common interactions with cattle involve daily [[cattle feeding|feeding]], cleaning and [[milking]]. Many routine husbandry practices involve [[ear tag]]ging, [[Livestock dehorning|dehorning]], loading, [[Veterinary surgery|medical operations]], vaccinations and [[Cloven hoof|hoof]] care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. Also, some [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] occur in working with cattle; the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on [[Ethology|behavioural techniques]], whereas in Europe, cattle are controlled primarily by physical means, such as [[fence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lott |first=Dale F. |author2=Hart, Benjamin L. |title=Applied ethology in a nomadic cattle culture |journal=Applied Animal Ethology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=309–319 |publisher=Elsevier B.V. |date=October 1979 |doi=10.1016/0304-3762(79)90102-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breeders use cattle husbandry to reduce [[Mycobacterium bovis|''M. bovis'' infection]] susceptibility by [[selective breeding]] and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krebs JR, Anderson T, Clutton-Brock WT |title=Bovine tuberculosis in cattle and badgers: an independent scientific review |publisher=Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food |year=1997 |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/publications/hpanel.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=4 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722232232/http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/publications/hpanel.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-22|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle are farmed for beef, veal, dairy, and leather, and they are less commonly used for [[conservation grazing]], simply to maintain grassland for wildlife – for example, in [[Epping Forest]], England. They are often used in some of the most wild places for livestock. Depending on the breed, cattle can survive on hill grazing, heaths, marshes, moors and semidesert. Modern cattle are more commercial than older breeds and, having become more specialized, are less versatile. For this reason, many smaller farmers still favor old breeds, such as the [[Jersey cattle|Jersey]] dairy breed.
In Portugal, Spain, [[southern France]] and some Latin American countries, bulls are used in the activity of [[bullfighting]];  ''[[Jallikattu]]'' in India is a bull taming sport radically different from European bullfighting, humans are unarmed and bulls are not killed. In many other countries bullfighting is illegal. Other activities such as [[bull riding]] are seen as part of a [[rodeo]], especially in North America. [[Bull-leaping]], a central ritual in [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] culture (see [[Sacred Bull]]), still exists in southwestern France.  In modern times, cattle are also entered into [[Cattle judging|agricultural competitions]]. These competitions can involve live cattle or cattle carcases in hoof and hook events.

In terms of food intake by humans, consumption of cattle is less efficient than of grain or vegetables with regard to [[land use]], and hence cattle grazing consumes more area than such other agricultural production when raised on grains.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Edward O. Wilson, ''The Future of Life'', 2003, Vintage Books, 256 pages {{ISBN|0-679-76811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, cattle and other forms of domesticated animals can sometimes help to use plant resources in areas not easily amenable to other forms of agriculture. Bulls are sometimes used as [[guard dog|guard animals]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.es/20161026/bulls-replace-guard-dogs-at-scrap-yard-in-valencia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travelandleisure.com/animals/junkyard-bulls-spain&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:Cow female black white.jpg|thumb|[[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cattle]] are the primary dairy breed, bred for high milk production.]]
The meat of adult cattle is known as [[beef]], and that of [[calf|calves]] is [[veal]].  Other animal parts are also used as food products, including blood, [[liver]], [[kidney]], [[heart]] and [[oxtail]].  Cattle also produce [[milk]], and [[dairy cattle]] are specifically bred to produce the large quantities of milk processed and sold for human consumption. Cattle today are the basis of a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. The [[international trade]] in beef for 2000 was over $30 billion and represented only 23% of world beef production.&lt;ref&gt;(Clay 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The production of milk, which is also made into cheese, butter, [[yogurt]], and other dairy products, is comparable in economic size to beef production, and provides an important part of the food supply for many of the world's people. Cattle hides, used for leather to make shoes, [[couch]]es and clothing, are another widespread product.  Cattle remain broadly used as draft animals in many [[Developing country|developing countries]], such as India. Cattle are also used in some sporting games, including [[rodeo]] and [[bullfighting]].&lt;!-- and add other games--&gt;

[[Gut flora]] in cattle include [[methanogen]]s that [[methanogenesis|produce methane]] as a byproduct of [[enteric fermentation]], which cattle belch out.

A report from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) states that the livestock sector is "responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions".&lt;ref name=Steinfeld&gt;Steinfeld, H. et al. 2006,  Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options.

One of the cited changes suggested to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is intensification of the livestock industry, since intensification leads to less land for a given level of production. This assertion is supported by studies of the US beef production system, suggesting practices prevailing in 2007 involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions, 12.1% less water use, and 33.0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than those used in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Capper |first1=J.

Sci. |volume=89 |issue= 12|pages=4249–4261 |doi=10.2527/jas.2010-3784}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis took into account not only practices in [[feedlot]]s, but also feed production (with less feed needed in more intensive production systems), forage-based cow-calf operations and back-grounding before cattle enter a feedlot (with more beef produced per head of cattle from those sources, in more intensive systems), and beef from animals derived from the dairy industry.

The number of American cattle kept in confined feedlot conditions fluctuates. From 1 January 2002 through 1 January 2012, there was no significant overall upward or downward trend in the number of US cattle on feed for slaughter, which averaged about 14.046 million head over that period.&lt;ref name=USDA201176&gt;USDA. 2011.

A CAFO that discharges pollutants is required to obtain a permit, which requires a plan to manage nutrient runoff, manure, chemicals, contaminants, and other wastewater pursuant to the US [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;US Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 122.23, 40 CFR 122.42&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations involving CAFO permitting have been extensively litigated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4003887446881112013&amp;q=National+Pork+Producers+Council+v+epa&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,27&amp;as_vis=1 ''See, e.g.,  Waterkeeper Alliance et al. v.

Commonly, CAFO wastewater and manure nutrients are applied to land at agronomic rates for use by forages or crops, and it is often assumed that various constituents of wastewater and manure, e.g. organic contaminants and pathogens, will be retained, inactivated or degraded on the land with application at such rates; however, additional evidence is needed to test reliability of such assumptions

Another concern is [[manure]], which if not well-managed, can lead to adverse environmental consequences. However, manure also is a valuable source of nutrients and organic matter when used as a fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/Tech/20ManMgn.htm |title=Manure management |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903054645/http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/lead/toolbox/Tech/20ManMgn.htm |archivedate=3 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manure was used as a fertilizer on about 15.8 million acres of US cropland in 2006, with manure from cattle accounting for nearly 70% of manure applications to soybeans and about 80% or more of manure applications to corn, wheat, barley, oats and sorghum.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. M. et al. 2009. Manure use for fertilizer and for energy. Report to Congress. USDA, AP-037. 53pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  Substitution of manure for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 [[megajoule]]s of fossil fuel energy would be used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;Shapouri, H. et al. 2002.

Grazing by cattle at low intensities can create a favourable environment for native herbs and [[forb]]s; in many world regions, though, cattle are reducing [[biodiversity]] due to [[overgrazing]].&lt;ref&gt;E.O. Wilson, ''The Future of Life'', 2003, Vintage Books, 256 pages {{ISBN|0-679-76811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A survey of refuge managers on 123 National Wildlife Refuges in the US tallied 86 species of wildlife considered positively affected and 82 considered negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying.&lt;ref&gt;Strassman, B. I. 1987. Effects of cattle grazing and haying on wildlife conservation at National Wildlife Refuges in the United States. Environmental Mgt. 11: 35–44 .&lt;/ref&gt; Proper management of pastures, notably [[managed intensive rotational grazing]] and grazing at low intensities can lead to less use of fossil fuel energy, increased recapture of carbon dioxide, fewer ammonia emissions into the atmosphere, reduced soil erosion, better air quality, and less water pollution.&lt;ref name="UCS" /&gt;

Cattle conservation and preservation is important for maintaining ecology of the rural areas and villages which in turn is crucial for nature conservation. '''Govidyapeetham, a cattle conservation institute''' by Aniruddha’s Institute of Gramin Vikas (Rural Development) situated in Karjat city in the state of Maharashtra, India is dedicated for research based reproduction of cows using modern technology.&lt;ref name="aniruddhafoundation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aniruddhafoundation.com/compassion-govidyapitham/|title=Govidyapitham – SHREE ANIRUDDHA UPASANA FOUNDATION|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File: Govidyapeetham1.jpg|thumb|Govidyapeetham, Cattle Conservation Institute, India]]

Cattle diseases were in the center of attention in the 1980s and 1990s when the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, was of concern.  Cattle might catch and develop various other diseases, like [[blackleg (disease)|blackleg]], [[bluetongue]], [[foot rot]] too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Common and important diseases of cattle |url=http://www.daff.gov.za/docs/Infopaks/commonDiseases.htm |accessdate=17 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205030006/http://www.daff.gov.za/docs/Infopaks/commonDiseases.htm |archivedate=5 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Identification of new cattle virus will help rule out mad cow disease |url=http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10688 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cattle Diseases |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_cattle_diseases |accessdate=4 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125074301/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/topic_cattle_diseases |archivedate=25 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, as cattle health is not only a veterinarian issue, but also a public health issue, [[public health]] and [[food safety]] standards and farming regulations directly affect the daily work of farmers who keep cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cattle Disease Guide |url=http://www.thecattlesite.com/diseaseinfo/ |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, said rules change frequently and are often debated.

[[Digital dermatitis]] is caused by the bacteria from the genus Treponema. It differs from foot rot and can appear under unsanitary conditions such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming, among other causes. It primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, however the milk quality remains unaffected. Cattle are also susceptible to [[ringworm]] caused by the fungus, ''[[Trichophyton verrucosum]]'', a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows.&lt;ref name=beneke1996&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beneke |first1=E. |last2=Rogers |first2=A. |title=Medical Mycology and Human Mycoses |date=1996 |publisher=Star |location=California |isbn=0-89863-175-0 |pages=85–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect of high stocking density ===

Stocking density refers to the number of animals within a specified area. When stocking density reaches high levels, the behavioural needs of the animals may not be met.  This can negatively influence health, welfare and production performance.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/11129/taking-advantage-of-natural-behavior-improves-dairy-cow-performance |title=Taking advantage of natural behavior improves dairy cow performance |last=Grant, R.|date=2011|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202101756/http://articles.extension.org/pages/11129/taking-advantage-of-natural-behavior-improves-dairy-cow-performance |archivedate=2 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of overstocking in cows can have a negative effect on [[Dairy|milk production]] and [[reproduction]] rates which are two very important traits for dairy farmers. Overcrowding of cows in barns has been found to reduced feeding, resting and rumination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although they consume the same amount of dry matter within the span of a day, they consume the food at a much more rapid rate, and this behaviour in cows can lead to further complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Huzzey |first1=J. |last2=Keyserlingk |first2=M. |last3=Overton |first3=T.|year=2012 |title=The behaviour and physiological consequences of overstocking dairy cattle |journal=American Association of Bovine Practitioners|pages=92 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feeding behaviour of cows during their post-milking period is very important as it has been proven that the longer animals can eat after milking, the longer they will be standing up and therefore causing less contamination to the teat ends.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tyler |first1=J.W, |last2=Fox |first2=L.K. |last3=Parish |first3=S.M. |last4=Swain |first4=J. |last5=Johnson |first5=D.J. |last6=Grassechi |first6=H.A. |year=1997 |title=Effect of feed availability on post-milking standing time in dairy cows |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022029997002501 |journal=Journal of Dairy Research |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=617–620|doi=10.1017/s0022029997002501}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is necessary to reduce the risk of mastitis as infection has been shown to increase the chances of embryonic loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schefers |first1=J.M. |last2=Weigel |first2=K.A. |last3=Rawson |first3=C.L. |last4=Zwald |first4=N.R. |last5=Cook |first5=N.B. |year=2010 |title=Management practices associated with conception rate and service rate of lactating Holstein cows in large, commercial dairy herds |journal=J.

[[Cortisol]] is an important stress hormone; its plasma concentrations increase greatly when subjected to high levels of stress.&lt;ref name="Sjaasted O.V. 2010"&gt;Sjaasted O.V., Howe K., Sand O., (2010) Physiology of Domestic Animals. 3rd edition. Sunderland: Sinaver Association. Inc&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased concentration levels of cortisol have been associated with significant increases in gonadotrophin levels and lowered progestin levels. Reduction of stress is important in the reproductive state of cows as an increase in [[Gonadotropin|gonadotrophin]] and lowered [[progesterone]] levels may impinge on the [[Ovulation|ovulatory]] and [[Luteal phase|lutenization]] process and to reduce the chances of successful implantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nepomnaschy |first1=B.

{{Main|Ox}}
[[File:India.Mumbai.04.jpg|thumb|Draft [[Zebus]] in [[Mumbai]], Maharashtra, India]]
'''Oxen''' (singular '''ox''') are cattle trained as [[draft animal]]s. Often they are adult, [[castration|castrated]] males of larger breeds, although females and bulls are also used in some areas. Usually, an [[ox]] is over four years old due to the need for training and to allow it to grow to full size. Oxen are used for [[plowing]], transport, hauling cargo, grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines, [[irrigation]] by powering pumps, and [[wagon]] drawing. Oxen were commonly used to skid logs in forests, and sometimes still are, in low-impact, select-cut logging. Oxen are most often used in teams of two, paired, for light work such as [[cart]]ing, with additional pairs added when more power is required, sometimes up to a total of 20 or more.
[[File:Traditional Farming Methods and Equipments.jpg|thumb|Oxen used in Plowing]]
An ox is a mature bovine which has learned to respond appropriately to a [[teamster]]'s signals. These signals are given by verbal commands or by noise (whip cracks). Verbal commands vary according to dialect and local tradition.  In one tradition in North America, the commands are:{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* "Back up": go backwards
* "Gee": turn right
* "Get up": walk forward
* "Haw": turn left
* "Whoa": stop
[[File:Sixten.jpg|right|thumb|Riding an ox in [[Hova, Sweden]]]]
Oxen can pull harder and longer than horses. Though not as fast as horses, they are less prone to injury because they are more sure-footed.

Many oxen are used worldwide, especially in [[Developing country|developing countries]].  About 11.3 million draft oxen are used in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Muruvimi, F. and J. Ellis-Jones.  1999.  A farming systems approach to improving draft animal power in Sub-Saharan Africa. In:  Starkey, P. and P. Kaumbutho.  1999.  Meeting the challenges of animal traction.  Intermediate Technology Publications, London.  pp. 10–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  In India, the number of draft cattle in 1998 was estimated at 65.7 million head.&lt;ref&gt;Phaniraja, K. L. and H. H. Panchasara.  2009.  Indian draught animals power.

{{further|Cattle slaughter in India}}

Cattle are venerated within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religion of India. In the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic period]] they were a symbol of plenty &lt;ref name="Jha2002"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Verso |isbn=978-1-85984-676-6 |last=Jha |first=D. N. |title=The myth of the holy cow |location=London |date=2002 |p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|130}} and were frequently slaughtered. In later times they gradually acquired their present status. According to the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', they are to be treated with the same respect 'as one's mother'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b041.htm |title=Mahabharata, Book 13-Anusasana Parva, Section LXXVI |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=15 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012075852/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b041.htm |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the first millennium, the consumption of beef began to be disfavoured by lawgivers.&lt;ref name="Jha2002" /&gt;{{rp|144}} Although there has never been any cow-goddesses or temples dedicated to them,&lt;ref name="Jha2002" /&gt;{{rp|146}} cows appear in numerous stories from the [[Veda]]s and [[Purana]]s. The deity [[Krishna]] was brought up in a family of cowherders, and given the name [[Govinda]] (protector of the cows). Also, [[Shiva]] is traditionally said to ride on the back of a bull named [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]].

Hinduism considers cow as divine and satvik (with pure virtues) and is worshipped as goddess. Medical science stresses importance of the cow for her milk, her urine as well as her excreta in our day-to-day life. Govidyapeetham, India aims to revive reproduction methodologies undertaken by Balram (brother of Lord Krishna, a deity in Hinduism) combining with modern technology.&lt;ref name="aniruddhafoundation.com"/&gt; 
[[File: Govidyapeetham2.jpg|thumb|Ancient Cattle Reproduction Methodologies Revived at Govidyapeetham, India]]

Milk and milk products were used in Vedic rituals.&lt;ref name="Jha2002" /&gt;{{rp|130}} In the postvedic period products of the cow – milk, curd, ghee, but also cow dung and urine ([[gomutra]]), or the combination of these five ([[panchagavya]]) – began to assume an increasingly important role in [[ritual purification]] and expiation.&lt;ref name="Jha2002" /&gt;{{rp|130–1}}

Veneration of the cow has become a symbol of the identity of Hindus as a community,&lt;ref name="Jha2002" /&gt;{{rp|20}} especially since the end of the 19th century. Slaughter of cows (including oxen, bulls and calves) is forbidden by law in several states of the Indian Union. [[McDonald's]] outlets in India do not serve any beef burgers. In Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]'s empire of the early 19th century, the killing of a cow was punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newindianexpress.com/opinion/article158600.ece |title=Save the cow, save earth |publisher=Express Buzz |first=Subramanian |last=Swamy |date=19 January 2016 |accessdate=19 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910154833/http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinion/article158600.ece |archivedate=10 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''silkworm''' is the [[larva]] or [[caterpillar]] of the '''domestic silkmoth''', '''''Bombyx mori''''' ([[Latin]]: "silkworm of the [[mulberry]] tree"). It is an economically important insect, being a primary producer of [[silk]]. A silkworm's preferred food is [[white mulberry]] leaves, though they may eat other mulberry species and even [[osage orange]]. Domestic silkmoths are closely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of millennia of selective breeding. Wild silkmoths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are not as commercially viable in the production of silk.

[[Sericulture]], the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Prehistoric Textiles: the Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean |author=E. J. W. Barber |year=1992 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-00224-8 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnSlynSfeEIC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where it spread to [[India]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and the [[Western world|West]]. The silkworm was domesticated from the wild silkmoth ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'', which has a range from northern India to northern [[China]], Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of [[Russia]]. The domesticated silkworm derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=K. P. Arunkumar, Muralidhar Metta &amp; J.

Silkworms were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the [[Neolithic]] age. Before then, the tools to manufacture quantities of silk thread had not been developed. The domesticated ''B. mori'' and the wild ''[[Bombyx mandarina|B. mandarina]]'' can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolution: Principles and Processes |author=Brian K. Hall |series=Topics in Biology |year=2010 |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |isbn=978-0-7637-6039-7 |page=400 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V24EHUgEl5EC&amp;lpg=PA342}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}

Domestic silkmoths are very different from most members in the genus ''[[Bombyx]]''; not only have they lost the ability to fly, but their [[Animal coloration|color pigments]] are also lost.&lt;ref&gt;https://phys.org/news/2013-11-captive-thousands-years-impaired-olfactory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Mulberry silkworms can be categorized into three different but connected groups or types. The major groups of silkworms fall under the univoltine ("uni-"=one, "voltine"=brood frequency) and bivoltine categories. The univoltine breed is generally linked with the geographical area within greater Europe. The eggs of this type hibernate during winter due to the cold climate, and cross-fertilize only by spring, generating silk only once annually. The second type is called bivoltine and is normally found in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[Korea]]. The breeding process of this type takes place twice annually, a feat made possible through the slightly warmer climates and the resulting two life cycles. The polyvoltine type of mulberry silkworm can only be found in the tropics. The eggs are laid by female moths and hatch within nine to 12 days, so the resulting type can have up to eight separate life cycles throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trevisan|first=Adrian|title=Cocoon Silk: A Natural Silk Architecture|url=http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|publisher=Sense of Nature|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507085636/http://www.senature.com/research/publications/cocoon-silk-a-natural-architecture|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 10746 An adult silkworm moth.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Adult silk moth]]
[[File:Silkmoth.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Wild silkmoth ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'']]

Eggs take about 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a preference for [[Morus alba|white mulberry]], having an attraction to the mulberry odorant [[jasmone|cis-jasmone]]. They are not [[monophagous]] since they can eat other species of ''[[Morus (plant)|Morus]]'', as well as some other [[Moraceae]], mostly [[Osage orange]]. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to [[ecdysis|molt]]. After molting, the [[instar]] phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.

After they have molted four times, their bodies become slightly yellow and the skin becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the [[pupa]]l phase of their lifecycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the [[salivary glands]]. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other [[Lepidoptera]] produce cocoons, but only a few—the [[Bombycidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Bombyx]]'', and the [[Saturniidae]], in particular the genus ''[[Antheraea]]''—have been exploited for fabric production.

If the animal is allowed to survive after spinning its cocoon and through the pupal phase of its lifecycle, it  releases [[proteolytic enzyme]]s to make a hole in the cocoon so it can emerge as an adult moth. These enzymes are destructive to the silk and can cause the silk fibers to break down from over a mile in length to segments of random length, which seriously reduces the value of the silk [[yarn|threads]], but not silk cocoons used as "stuffing" available in China and elsewhere for doonas, jackets etc. To prevent this, silkworm cocoons are boiled. The heat kills the silkworms and the water makes the cocoons easier to unravel. Often, the silkworm itself is eaten.

As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larva, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was critical of silk production based on the [[Ahimsa]] philosophy "not to hurt any living thing". This led to Gandhi's promotion of cotton spinning machines, an example of which can be seen at the Gandhi Institute. He also promoted [[Ahimsa silk]], [[wild silk]] made from the cocoons of wild and semiwild silkmoths.&lt;ref&gt;"Mahatma Gandhi: 100 years", 1968, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LGVuAAAAMAAJ p. 349]&lt;/ref&gt;

The moth – the adult phase of the lifecycle – is not capable of functional flight, in contrast to the wild ''B. mandarina'' and other ''Bombyx'' species, whose males fly to meet females and for evasion from predators. Some may emerge with the ability to lift off and stay airborne, but sustained flight cannot be achieved. This is because their bodies are too big and heavy for their small wings. However, some silkmoths can still fly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjK6k70xNA8&lt;/ref&gt; Silkmoths have a wingspan of {{convert|3|–|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a white, hairy body. Females are about two to three times bulkier than males (for they are carrying many eggs), but are similarly colored. Adult [[Bombycidae]] have reduced mouth parts and do not feed, though a human caretaker can feed them.

== Cocoon ==
[[File:Cocoon.jpg|thumb|right|Cocoon of ''B. mori'']]

The cocoon is made of a thread of raw silk from 300 to about 900 m (1,000 to 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft) long. The fibers are very fine and lustrous, about 10 μm (0.0004&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter. About 2,000 to 3,000 cocoons are required to make a pound of silk (0.4&amp;nbsp;kg). At least 70 million pounds of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/603/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=603#ancor|title=faostat.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
[[File:Micrographia Schem 25 fig 2.jpg|thumb|A study of an egg of a silkworm from Hooke's ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]
[[File:Maria_Sibylla_Merian_Maulbeerbaum_samt_Frucht_plate_1.png|thumb|right|1679 study of the silkworm metamorphosis by [[Maria Sibylla Merian]], it depicts the fruit and leave of a [[mulberry]] tree and the eggs and larvae of the silkworm moth.]]

Due to its small size and ease of culture, the silkworm has become a [[model organism]] in the study of lepidopteran and arthropod biology. Fundamental findings on [[pheromone]]s, [[hormone]]s, brain structures, and physiology have been made with the silkworm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} One example of this was the molecular identification of the first known pheromone, [[bombykol]], which required extracts from 500,000 individuals, due to the very small quantities of pheromone produced by any individual worm.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Currently, research is focusing on genetics of silkworms and the possibility of genetic engineering. Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian mutation]]s have been described.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide.&lt;ref name="silkworm08"/&gt; One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins. ''Bombyx mori'' females are also one of the few organisms with homologous chromosomes held together only by the [[synaptonemal complex]] (and not crossovers) during [[meiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerton and Hawley|title=Homologous Chromosome Interactions in Meiosis: Diversity Amidst Conservation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2005|volume=6|pages=477–487|doi=10.1038/nrg1614|pmid=15931171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kraig Biocraft Laboratories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kraig Biocraft Laboratories|url=http://www.kraiglabs.com/spider-silk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
has used research from the [[University of Wyoming|Universities of Wyoming]] and [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] in a collaborative effort to create a silkworm that is genetically altered to produce spider silk. In September 2010, the effort was announced as successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Notre Dame|url=http://science.nd.edu/news/34100-hybrid-silkworms-spin-stronger-spider-silk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Tufts Medical Center|Tufts]] developed scaffolds made of spongy silk that feel and look similar to human tissue. They are implanted during reconstructive surgery to support or restructure damaged ligaments, tendons, and other tissue. They also created implants made of silk and drug compounds which can be implanted under the skin for steady and gradual time release of medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolchover, Natalie|url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/the_silk_renaissance/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[MIT Media Lab]] experimented with silkworms to see what they would weave when left on surfaces with different curvatures. They found that on particularly straight webs of lines, the worms would connect neighboring lines with silk, weaving directly onto the given shape. Using this knowledge they built a [[Neri Oxman#Silk Pavilion|silk pavilion]] with 6,500 silkworms over a number of days.

Silkworms have been used in antibiotics discovery as they have several advantageous traits compared to other invertebrate models.&lt;ref&gt;Panthee, S., Paudel, A., Hamamoto, H., and Sekimizu, K.

== Domestication ==
The domesticated form, compared to the wild form, has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion. It has gained tolerance to human presence and handling, and also to living in crowded conditions. The domesticated moth cannot fly, so it needs human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. The native color pigments are also lost, so the domesticated moths are leucistic since camouflage isn't useful when they only live in captivity. These changes have made the domesticated strains entirely dependent upon humans for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Marian R. Goldsmith, Toru Shimada &amp; Hiroaki Abe |year=2005 |title=The genetics and genomics of the silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |volume=50 |pages=71–100 |pmid=15355234 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs are kept in [[Incubator (egg)|incubators]] to aid in their hatching.

=== Silkworm breeding ===

Silkworms were first domesticated in China over 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hong-Song Yu1, Yi-Hong Shen, Gang-Xiang Yuan, et al. |title=Evidence of selection at melanin synthesis pathway loci during silkworm domestication |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1785–99 |year=2011 |pmid =21212153 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msr002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennis Normile |title=Sequencing 40 Silkworm Genomes Unravels History of Cultivation |journal=Science |volume=325 |pages=1058–1059  |year=2009 |pmid=19713499 |doi=10.1126/science.325_1058a |bibcode = 2009Sci...325.1058N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the silk production capacity of the species has increased nearly tenfold. The silkworm is one of the few organisms wherein the principles of genetics and breeding were applied to harvest maximum output {{citation needed|reason=many domesticated plants and animals have evolved through heterosis and cross-breeding|date=December 2017}}. It is second only to [[maize]] in exploiting the principles of [[heterosis]] and [[cross breeding]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Silkworm breeding is aimed at the overall improvement of silkworm from a commercial point of view. The major objectives are improving [[fecundity]] (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance. Healthy larvae lead to a healthy cocoon crop. Health is dependent on factors such as better [[pupation]] rate, fewer dead larvae in the mountage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountage: Meaning and Types {{!}} Sericulture|url=http://www.notesonzoology.com/sericulture/mountage-meaning-and-types-sericulture/200|website=Zoology Notes|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; shorter larval duration (shorter larval duration lessens the chance of infection) and bluish-tinged fifth-instar larvae (which are healthier than the reddish-brown ones). Quantity of cocoon and silk produced are directly related to the pupation rate and larval weight. Healthier larvae have greater pupation rates and cocoon weights. Quality of cocoon and silk depends on a number of factors including genetics.

=== Hobby raising and school projects ===
In the US, teachers may sometimes introduce the insect life cycle to their students by raising silkworms in the classroom as a science project. Students have a chance to observe complete life cycles of insect from egg stage to larvae, pupa, moth. &lt;!-- encyclopedic? In Israel this is done in kindergarten as well. --&gt;

The silkworm has been raised as a hobby in countries such as China, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Iran. Children often pass on the eggs, creating a non-commercial population. The experience provides children with the opportunity to witness the life cycle of silkworms. The practice of raising silkworms by children as pets has, in non-silk farming South Africa, led to the development of extremely hardy [[landrace]]s of silkworms, because they are invariably subjected to hardships not encountered by commercially farmed members of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkwormeggs.net/resources/Silkworm-School-Science-Project-Instruction.pdf |title=Silkworm School Science Project Instruction |format=PDF |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314044223/http://www.silkwormeggs.net/resources/Silkworm-School-Science-Project-Instruction.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these worms, not being selectively bred as such, are possibly inferior in silk production and may exhibit other undesirable traits.

The full [[genome]] of the silkworm was published in 2008 by the International Silkworm Genome Consortium.&lt;ref name="silkworm08"&gt;{{cite journal |author=The International Silkworm Genome Consortium |year=2008 |title=The genome of a lepidopteran model insect, the silkworm ''Bombyx mori'' |journal=Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1036–1045 |doi=10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.11.004 |pmid=19121390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Draft sequences were published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kazuei Mita |author2=Masahiro Kasahara |author3=Shin Sasaki |author4=Et al. |year=2004 |title=The genome sequence of silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |journal=[[DNA Research]] |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=27–35 |pmid=15141943 |doi=10.1093/dnares/11.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Xia Q, Zhou Z, Lu C, et al., Biology Analysis Group  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004 |title=A draft sequence for the genome of the domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=306 |issue=5703 |pages=1937–40 |pmid=15591204 |doi=10.1126/science.1102210|bibcode = 2004Sci...306.1937X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genome of the silkworm is mid-range with a [[genome size]] around 432 megabase pairs.

High genetic variability has been found in domestic lines of silkworms, though this is less than that among wild silkmoths (about 83 percent of wild genetic variation). This suggests a single event of domestication, and that it happened over a short period of time, with a large number of wild worms having been collected for domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Qingyou Xia, Yiran Guo, Ze Zhang, et al. |year=2009 |title=Complete resequencing of 40 genomes reveals domestication events and genes in silkworm (''Bombyx'') |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=326 |issue=5951 |pages=433–436 |doi=10.1126/science.1176620 |pmid=19713493 |bibcode=2009Sci...326..433X |url=http://life.cqu.edu.cn/zezhang/silkwormDomest_Sci09-10-16.pdf |format=PDF |pmc=3951477 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major questions, however, remain unanswered: "Whether this event was in a single location or in a short period of time in several locations cannot be deciphered from the data".

== Cuisine ==
[[File:Silkworm pupae to eat.jpg|thumb|Silkworm pupae dishes]]
Silkworm pupae are [[Entomophagy|eaten]] in some cultures.

* In [[Assam]], they are boiled for extracting silk and the boiled pupae are eaten directly with salt or fried with chilli pepper or herbs as a snack or dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timescity.com/blog/weird-foods-in-india/ |title=10 Weird Foods in India - Eri polu | date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Korea, they are boiled and seasoned to make a popular snack food known as ''[[beondegi]]'' (번데기).
* In China, street vendors sell roasted silkworm pupae.
* In Japan, silkworms are usually served as a ''[[tsukudani]]'' (佃煮), i.e., boiled in a sweet-sour sauce made with [[soy sauce]] and sugar.
* In [[Vietnam]], this is known as ''{{lang|vi|con nhộng}}''.
* Silkworms have also been proposed for cultivation by astronauts as [[space food]] on long-term missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/01/13-02.html |title=Care for a Silkworm With Your Tang? |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |date=13 January 2009 |work=ScienceNOW Daily News |accessdate=14 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225234236/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2009/01/13-02.html |archivedate=25 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silkworm legends ==
{{See also|Horse in Chinese mythology#Origins of sericulture}}
In China, a legend indicates the discovery of the silkworm's silk was by an ancient empress [[Lei Zu]], the wife of the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the daughter of XiLing-Shi. She was drinking tea under a tree when a silk cocoon fell into her tea. As she picked it out and started to wrap the silk thread around her finger, she slowly felt a warm sensation. When the silk ran out, she saw a small larva. In an instant, she realized this caterpillar larva was the source of the silk. She taught this to the people and it became widespread. Many more legends about the silkworm are told.

The Chinese guarded their knowledge of silk, but, according to one story, a Chinese princess given in marriage to a [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] prince brought to the oasis the secret of silk manufacture, "hiding silkworms in her hair as part of her dowry", probably in the first half of the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Underhill Wisseman, Wendell S. Williams. ''Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials ''. Routledge, 1994. {{ISBN|2-88124-632-X}}. Page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  About AD 550, Christian monks are said to have smuggled silkworms, in a hollow stick, out of China and sold the secret to the [[Byzantine Empire]].

== Silkworm diseases ==
*''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'', a fungus, destroys the entire silkworm body. This fungus usually appears when silkworms are raised under cold conditions with high humidity. This disease is not passed on to the eggs from moths, as the infected silkworms cannot survive to the moth stage. This fungus can spread to other insects.
*[[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|Grasserie]], also known as nuclear polyhedrosis, milky disease, or hanging disease, is caused by infection with the ''Bombyx mori'' nuclear polyhedrosis virus. If grasserie is observed in the chawkie stage, then the chawkie larvae must have been infected while hatching or during chawkie rearing. Infected eggs can be disinfected by cleaning their surfaces prior to hatching. Infections can occur as a result of improper hygiene in the chawkie rearing house. This disease develops faster in early instar rearing.
*[[Pebrine]] is a disease caused by a parasitic microsporidian, ''Nosema bombycis'' Nageli. Diseased larvae show slow growth,  undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite. Tiny black spots appear on larval integument. Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death.
*''[[Nosema (microsporidian)|N. bombycis]]'' kills 100% of silkworms hatched from infected eggs. This disease can be carried over from worms to moths, then eggs and worms again. This microsporidium comes from the food the silkworms eat. If silkworms get this disease in their worm stage, no visible symptoms occur. However, mother moths pass the disease to the eggs, and 100% of worms hatching from the diseased eggs will die in their worm stage. To prevent this disease, it is extremely important to rule out all eggs from infected moths by checking the moth's body fluid under a microscope.

== Traditional Chinese medicine ==
In [[traditional Chinese medicine]], silkworm is the source of the "stiff silkworm", which is made from dried fourth- or fifth-instar [[larva]]e which have died of "white muscardine disease", the ''Beauveria bassiana'' fungal infection mentioned above. It is believed to dispel [[flatulence]], dissolve [[phlegm]], and relieve [[spasm]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The '''donkey''' or '''ass''' (''Equus africanus asinus'')&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] member of the horse family, [[Equidae]]. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the [[African wild ass]], ''E. africanus''. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in [[underdeveloped]] countries, where they are used principally as draught or [[pack animal]]s. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.

A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet;&lt;ref name=oad/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncd/&gt;&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; a young donkey is a [[foal]].&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Jack donkeys are often used to mate with female [[horse]]s to produce [[mule]]s; the biological "reciprocal" of a mule, from a [[stallion]] and jenny as its parents instead, is called a [[hinny]].

Asses were first [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, probably in [[Egypt]] or [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rossel/&gt;  and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.  While domesticated species are increasing in numbers,  the African wild ass is an [[endangered species]]. As [[Working animal|beasts of burden]] and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.

==Scientific and common names==
Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus asinus asinus'' based on the [[Priority (nomenclature)|principle of priority]] used for scientific names of animals. However, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] ruled in 2003 that if the domestic species and the wild species are considered subspecies of one another, the scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies.&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; This means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus africanus asinus'' when it is considered a subspecies, and ''Equus asinus'' when it is considered a species.

At one time, the [[synonym]] ''ass'' was the more common term for the donkey. The first recorded use of ''donkey'' was in either 1784&lt;ref name=fairman/&gt; or 1785.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=grose/&gt;&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; While the word ''ass'' has [[cognate]]s in most other [[Indo-European languages]], ''donkey'' is an [[etymology|etymologically]] obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its derivation include the following:
* Perhaps from Spanish, for its [[Don (honorific)|don]]-like gravity; the donkey was also known as "the King of Spain's trumpeter"&lt;ref name=grose/&gt;
* Perhaps a diminutive of ''[[dun gene|dun]]'' (dull grayish-brown), a typical donkey colour.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;
* Perhaps from the name ''Duncan''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD4donkey"/&gt;
* Perhaps of imitative origin.&lt;ref name="AHD4donkey" /&gt;
From the 18th century, ''donkey'' gradually replaced ''ass'', and ''jenny'' replaced ''she-ass'', which is now considered archaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eselin |website=German-English Dictionary |url=http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Eselin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of ''[[rooster]]'' for ''cock'', or that of ''rabbit'' for ''coney'', which was formerly [[homophone|homophonic]] with ''[[cunny]]''. By the end of the 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both ''ass'' and ''[[buttocks|arse]]'' had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for the ass in English from this time include ''cuddy'' in Scotland, ''neddy'' in southwest England and ''dicky'' in the southeast;&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; ''moke'' is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.

==Characteristics==
{{See also| List of donkey breeds}}
[[File:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|upright|Classic British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]]]]  Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management. The height at the [[withers]] ranges from {{hands|7.3|to|15.3}}, and the weight from {{convert|80|to|480|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years;&lt;ref name=nsw/&gt; in more prosperous countries, they may have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys are adapted to marginal [[desert]] lands. Unlike [[wild horse|wild]] and [[feral horse]]s, wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form [[Harem (zoology)|harems]]. Each adult donkey establishes a home range; breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack.&lt;ref name=svend3/&gt; The loud call or bray of the donkey, which typically lasts for twenty seconds&lt;ref name=canacoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehead/&gt; and can be heard for over three kilometres, may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/wells_kels/Adapation.htm|title = Adaption of Donkeys|date = |accessdate =May 4, 2015|website = BioWeb|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys have large ears, which may pick up more distant sounds, and may help cool the donkey's blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mikesdonkeys.co.uk/facts.html|title = Donkey Facts|date = |accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Mike's Donkeys|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys can defend themselves by biting, striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs.

===Breeding===
[[File:Equus asinus Kadzidłowo 001.jpg|thumb|left|A 3-week-old donkey]]
A jenny is normally pregnant for about 12 months, though the gestation period varies from 11 to 14 months,&lt;ref name=alberta /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;[http://www.albertadonkeyandmule.com/pdfs/foaling-out-the-jennet.pdf Sewell, Sybil E.  "Foaling out the Donkey Jennet," ''Alberta Donkey and Mule.com''.  Web page accessed March 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and usually gives birth to a single foal. Births of twins are rare, though less so than in horses.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; About 1.7 percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins; both foals survive in about 14 percent of those.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ramshornstudio.com/donkeys.htm|title = Twins and Donkeys|accessdate = May 4, 2015 |website = Rams Horn Studio|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general jennies have a conception rate that is lower than that of horses (''i.e.'' less than the 60–65% rate for mares).&lt;ref name=alberta /&gt;

Although jennies come into heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their fertility remains low, and it is likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Thus it is usual to wait one or two further [[oestrous]] cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their [[foal]]s, and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side.&lt;ref name="Rachau"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oregonvos.net/~jrachau/pregnant.htm |title=Rachau,  Jeanine A. "Gestation and Foaling of Donkeys" |access-date=2015-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412031614/http://www.oregonvos.net/~jrachau/pregnant.htm |archive-date=2009-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys can interbreed with other members of the family Equidae, and are commonly interbred with horses. The [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a jack and a [[mare]] is a [[mule]], valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the [[Asino di Martina Franca]], the [[Baudet de Poitou]] and the [[American mammoth donkey|Mammoth Jack]] are raised only for mule production. The hybrid between a [[stallion]] and a jenny is a [[hinny]], and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Donkeys can also breed with [[zebra]]s in which the offspring is called a [[Zebroid|zonkey]] (among other names).

===Behaviour===
Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of [[self-preservation]] than exhibited by horses.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hartshorsemanship.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=controller.viewPageThoughtDetail&amp;thoughtUuid=BE68EBFE-4063-C7B3-5EB13796296E636C|title = Training Donkeys|date = |accessdate = May 4, 2015|website = Harts Horsemanship|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although formal studies of their [[ethology|behaviour]] and [[animal cognition|cognition]] are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livestockoftheworld.com/Donkeys/AboutDonkeys.asp|title=About Donkeys {{!}} Breeds of Donkeys|last=World|first=Livestock Of The|website=www.livestockoftheworld.com|access-date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Evolution of the horse}}
[[File:Equus eisenmannae.JPG|thumb|Skull of a giant extinct horse, ''Equus eisenmannae'']]
The genus ''Equus'', which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from ''[[Dinohippus]]'', via the intermediate form ''[[Plesippus]]''. One of the oldest species is ''[[Hagerman Horse|Equus simplicidens]]'', described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged ''Equus livenzovensis'' documented from western Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name = "Azzaroli1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azzaroli |first=A. |year=1992 |title=Ascent and decline of monodactyl equids: a case for prehistoric overkill |journal=Ann.

Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus ''Equus'') lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recalibrating ''Equus evolution'' using the genome sequence of an early Middle Pleistocene horse |last1=Orlando|first1= L.|last2=Ginolhac|first2= A.|last3=Zhang|first3= G.|last4=Froese|first4= D.|last5=Albrechtsen|first5= A.|last6=Stiller|first6= M.|last7=Schubert|first7= M.|last8=Cappellini|first8= E.|last9=Petersen|first9= B.|journal=Nature|date=4 July 2013 |doi=10.1038/nature12323 |pmid=23803765 |volume=499 |issue=7456 |pages=74–8|display-authors=etal|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/recalibrating-equus-evolution-using-the-genome-sequence-of-an-early-middle-pleistocene-horse(f4a404d6-2202-4a92-90c7-d113aee17b2d).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus ''E.

All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] forms) belong to the subgenus ''E.

&lt;ref name=Albano/&gt; Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in [[Ma'adi]] in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in [[Nubia]], and they supplanted the [[ox]] as the chief pack animal of that culture. The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to [[chewing the cud|chew their cud]], and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt. In the [[Dynasty IV]] era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;  In 2003, the tomb of either [[Narmer|King Narmer]] or [[Hor-Aha|King Hor-Aha]] (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;
[[File:Wild Burros.jpg|thumb|[[Feral]] burros in [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rock Canyon]]|left]]
By the end of the fourth millennium BC, the donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding center had shifted to [[Mesopotamia]] by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made [[Damascus]] famous{{Citation_needed|date=April 2016}}, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy [[horse gait|gait]]. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in [[Arabia]]. By the second millennium BC, the donkey was brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as [[viticulture]] was introduced, as the donkey is associated with the Syrian god of wine, [[Dionysus]]. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;

The first donkeys came to the Americas on ships of the [[Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|Second Voyage]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], and were landed at [[Hispaniola]] in 1495.&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; The first to reach North America may have been two animals taken to Mexico by [[Juan de Zumárraga]], the first bishop of Mexico, who arrived there on 6 December 1528, while the first donkeys to reach what is now the United States may have crossed the [[Rio Grande]] with [[Juan de Oñate]] in April 1598.&lt;ref name=burro/&gt; From that time on they spread northward, finding use in missions and mines. Donkeys were documented as present in what today is Arizona in 1679. By the [[Gold Rush]] years of the 19th century, the burro was the [[Pack animal|beast of burden]] of choice of early [[Prospecting|prospectors]] in the western United States. With the end of the [[placer mining]] boom, many of them escaped or were abandoned, and a [[Feral organism|feral]] population established itself.

==Present status==
About 41 million donkeys were reported worldwide in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; [[China]] had the most with 11 million, followed by [[Pakistan]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Mexico]]. As of 2017, however, the Chinese population was reported to have dropped to 3 million, with African populations under pressure as well, due to increasing trade and demand for donkey products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41524710|title=Donkeys face 'biggest ever crisis'|last=Leithead|first=Alastair|date=2017-10-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted.&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt; The number of breeds and percentage of world population for each of the FAO's world regions was in 2006:&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

In 1997 the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations, conversion of forests to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blench 2000"/&gt;
Since then, the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking, falling from 43.7 million to 43.5 million between 1995 and 2000, and to only 41 million in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; The fall in population is pronounced in developed countries; in Europe, the total number of donkeys fell from 3 million in 1944 to just over 1 million in 1994.&lt;ref name=svend5/&gt;

The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; In 2000 the number of [[List of donkey breeds|breeds of donkey]] recorded worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77. The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal Genetic Resources project.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt; The rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries. In France, for example, only one breed, the Baudet de Poitou, was recognised prior to the early 1990s; by 2005, a further six donkey breeds had official recognition.&lt;ref name=inra/&gt;

In prosperous countries, the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has become a concern, and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up. The largest is [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] near Sidmouth, England, which also supports donkey welfare projects in Egypt, Ethiopia, India, [[Kenya]], and Mexico.&lt;ref name="DS 2006"/&gt;

==Uses==

===Economic use===
[[File:104 Donkeys in Tayrona Park Colombia.JPG|thumb|Donkeys bring supplies through the jungle to a camp outpost in [[Tayrona National Natural Park]] in northern [[Colombia]]]] [[File:Esel auf Ydra.jpg|thumb|On [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|the island of Hydra]], because cars are outlawed, donkeys and mules form virtually the sole method of heavy goods transport.]] [[File:Carisbrooke_Castle_well_house_3.jpg|thumb|A donkey operating a water well at [[Carisbrooke Castle]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].]]
The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. Of the more than 40 million donkeys in the world, about 96% are in [[underdeveloped]] countries, where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture. After human labour, the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power.&lt;ref name=pearson/&gt; They may also be ridden, or used for threshing, raising water, milling and other work. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels.&lt;ref name=aluja/&gt; Some cultures that prohibit women from working with [[oxen]] in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys, allowing them to be used by both sexes.&lt;ref name=ifad/&gt;

In developed countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared, donkeys are used to sire mules, to guard [[sheep]],&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=dohner/&gt; for [[donkey rides]] for children or tourists, and as pets. Donkeys may be pastured or stabled with horses and ponies, and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses. If a donkey is introduced to a [[Mare (horse)|mare]] and [[foal]], the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mother.&lt;ref name=ypte/&gt;

A few donkeys are milked or raised for meat;&lt;ref name="Starkey 1997"/&gt; in Italy, which has the highest consumption of equine meat in Europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, about 1000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately 100 tonnes of meat.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; [[Asses' milk]] may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was €15 per litre,&lt;ref name=latte/&gt; and a price of €6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes. The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; In the past, donkey skin was used in the production of [[parchment]].&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; In 2017, the UK based charity [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] estimated that 1.8 million skins were traded every year, but the demand could be as high as 10 million.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41524710|title=Why are donkeys facing their 'biggest ever crisis'?|last=Leithead|first=Alastair|date=7 October 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes, and [[Guo Li Zhuang]] restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes. [[Donkey-hide gelatin]] is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional Chinese medicine product. [[Donkey-hide gelatin|Ejiao]], the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins, can sell for up to $388 per kilo, at October 2017 prices.

In 2017, a drop in the number of Chinese donkeys, combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce, meant that Chinese suppliers began to look to Africa. As a result of the increase in demand, and the price that could be charged, [[Kenya]] opened three donkey abattoirs. Concerns for donkeys' well-being, however, have resulted in a number of African countries (including [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]], and [[Senegal]]) banning China from buying their donkey products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===In warfare===
During World War I [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], a British stretcher bearer serving with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], and Richard Alexander "Dick" Henderson of the [[New Zealand Medical Corps]] used donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].&lt;ref name=anzac/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzh/&gt;

According to British food writer [[Matthew Fort]], donkeys were used in the [[Italian Army]]. The Mountain Fusiliers each had a donkey to [[pack animal|carry]] their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be [[horsemeat|eaten]].&lt;ref name=Vespa/&gt;

Donkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and others.&lt;ref name=evans/&gt;&lt;ref name=boaz/&gt;

==Care==

===Shoeing===
Donkey hooves are more elastic than those of horses, and do not naturally wear down as fast. Regular clipping may be required; neglect can lead to permanent damage.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; Working donkeys may need to be shod. Donkey shoes are similar to [[horseshoe]]s, but usually smaller and without toe-clips.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Nutrition===

In their native arid and semi-arid climates, donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub.&lt;ref name=svend2/&gt; The donkey has a tough [[digestive system]] in which roughage is efficiently broken down by [[hind gut fermentation]], microbial action in the [[caecum]] and [[large intestine]].&lt;ref name=svend2/&gt; While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight,&lt;ref name=smith2008/&gt; approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter,&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt; compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;[http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/FreePubs/pdfs/uc099.pdf Hall, Marvin H. and Patricia M. Comerford. "Pasture and Hay for Horses - Argonomy facts 32," 1992 University of Pennsylvania, Cooperative Extension Service.]  Web site accessed February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys are also less prone to [[colic]].&lt;ref name=svendsen/&gt; The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different [[intestinal flora]] to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

[[File:Baudet.jpg|thumb|[[Baudet de Poitou|Poitou donkeys]].]]
Donkeys obtain most of their energy from [[Dietary fiber|structural carbohydrates]]. Some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only [[straw]] (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or [[hay]] in the winter,&lt;ref name=sanct/&gt; to get all the energy, protein, fat and vitamins it requires; others recommend some grain to be fed, particularly to working animals,&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt; and others advise against feeding straw.&lt;ref name=blm/&gt;   They do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods. They can meet their nutritional needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass.  They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Aganga, A.A., ''et al.'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063807/http://www.cipav.org.co/lrrd/lrrd12/2/agan122.htm "Feeding donkeys"] ''Livestock Research for Rural Development'' 12 (2) 2000. Department of Animal Science and Production, Botswana College of Agriculture. Web site accessed July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder ([[laminitis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071119104524/http://www.dengie.com/pages/feeding-horses/nutritional-advice/feeding-your-donkey.php "Feeding Your Donkey"]  Web site accessed July 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[hyperlipaemia]],&lt;ref name=sanct/&gt; or to [[gastric ulcers]].&lt;ref name=Burden2009/&gt;

Throughout the world, working donkeys are associated with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level.&lt;ref name=aluja/&gt; Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the [[Third World]] are under-nourished and over-worked.&lt;ref name=svend4/&gt;

==Burro==
[[File:DonkeyCartCarnHuejot2.JPG|thumb|A burro pulling a cart during the [[Carnival of Huejotzingo]]]]
In the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Americas]], a '''{{lang|es|burro}}''' is a small donkey.  The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] lists the burro as a specific breed of ass.&lt;ref name="dadburro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dad.fao.org/cgi-bin/EfabisWeb.cgi?sid=1b9408faaf38cf3a67973ce670aa7736,reportsreport13_50000044 |title=Breeds from species: Ass |website=Domestic Animal Diversity Information System |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |accessdate=April 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]], the donkey population is estimated at three million.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;Garcia-Navarro, Lourdes (8 May 2005) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4635078 "Celebrating the Burro in Mexico"] (transcript of radio broadcast). Accessed February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also substantial ''burro'' populations in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Nicaragua]].

''Burro'' is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for donkey. In Spanish, burros may also be called ''{{lang|es|burro {{sic|mexicano|hide=y|reason=Adjectival forms of nationalities are not capitalized in Spanish}}}}'' ('Mexican donkey'), ''{{lang|es|burro criollo}}'' ('[[Criollo people|Criollo]] donkey'), or ''{{lang|es|burro criollo {{sic|mexicano|hide=y|reason=Adjectival forms of nationalities are not capitalized in Spanish}}}}''. In the United States, "burro" is used as a [[Loanword|loan word]] by English speakers to describe any small donkey used primarily as a pack animal, as well as to describe the [[Feral organism|feral]] donkeys that live in [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], [[Texas]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="blm" /&gt;

Among donkeys, burros tend to be on the small side. A study of working burros in central Mexico found a weight range of {{convert|50|–|186|kg}}, with an average weight of {{convert|122|kg|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|112|kg|abbr=on}} for females. Height at the [[withers]] varied from {{convert|87|–|120|cm|abbr=on}}, with an average of approximately {{convert|108|cm|abbr=on}}, and girth measurements ranged from {{convert|88|–|152|cm|abbr=on}}, with an average of about {{convert|120|cm|abbr=on}}. The average age of the burros in the study was 6.4 years; evaluated by their [[horse teeth|teeth]], they ranged from 1 to 17 years old.&lt;ref name="aluja" /&gt; They are gray in color. Mexican burros tend to be smaller than their counterparts in the USA, which are both larger and more robust. To strengthen their bloodstock, in May 2005, the state of [[Jalisco]] imported 11 male and female donkeys from Kentucky.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

==Feral donkeys and wild asses==
In some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established [[feral]] populations such as those of the [[Burro]] of North America and the [[Asinara donkey]] of [[Sardinia]], Italy, both of which have protected status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of [[equid]], such as Hawaii.&lt;ref name="feral"/&gt; In Australia, where there may be 5 million [[Feral donkeys in Australia|feral donkeys]],&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

===Wild asses, onagers, and kiangs===
Few species of ass exist in the wild. The [[African wild ass]], ''Equus africanus'', has two subspecies, the [[Equus africanus somaliensis|Somali wild ass]], ''Equus africanus somaliensis'', and the [[Equus africanus africanus|Nubian wild ass]], ''Equus africanus africanus'',&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; Both are critically endangered.&lt;ref name=iucn2/&gt; Extinct species include the [[European ass]], ''Equus hydruntinus'', which became extinct during the [[Neolithic]], and the [[Equus africanus atlanticus|North African wild ass]], ''Equus africanus atlanticus'', which became extinct in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

There are five subspecies of Asiatic wild ass or [[onager]], ''Equus hemionus'', and three subspecies of the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang'', of the Himalayan upland.

==Donkey hybrids==
A male donkey (jack) can be crossed with a female horse to produce a [[mule]]. A male horse can be crossed with a female donkey to produce a [[hinny]].

Horse-donkey [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] are almost always [[infertility|sterile]] because horses have 64 [[chromosome]]s whereas donkeys have 62, producing offspring with 63 chromosomes. Mules are much more common than hinnies. This is believed to be caused by two factors, the first being proven in cat hybrids, that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher, fertility rates drop (as in the case of stallion x jenney). {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss. In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology. Due to different [[mating]] behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennys. Further, mares are usually larger than jennys and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth. It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce.{{Citation needed|reason=to make this statement, one needs data indicating the greater prevalence of mules|date=August 2009}}

The offspring of a [[zebra]]-donkey cross is called a zonkey, [[zebroid]], zebrass, or zedonk;&lt;ref name=zorse/&gt; ''zebra mule'' is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. ''Zebra hinny, zebret'' and ''zebrinny'' all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras.&lt;ref name=zedonk/&gt; There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; there is no such limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.

==Cultural references==
The long history of human donkey use has created a rich store of cultural references:

===Religion, myth and folklore===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Procession in the Streets of Jerusalem (Le cortège dans les rues de Jérusalem) - James Tissot.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Jesus]] rode on a donkey in his [[triumphal entry into Jerusalem]]]]
Due to its widespread domestication and use, the donkey is referred to in myth and folklore around the world.  In classical and ancient cultures, donkeys had a part. The donkey was the symbol of the Egyptian sun god [[Ra]] .&lt;ref name=gauding/&gt; In [[Greek myth]], [[Silenus]] is pictured in Classical Antiquity and during the Renaissance (''illustration, left'') drunken and riding a donkey, and [[Midas]] was given the ears of an ass after misjudging a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]], beginning in the first book and continuing through both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, so they became part of Judeo-Christian tradition. They are portrayed as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender. In contrast, horses were represented only in the context of war, ridden by [[cavalry]] or pulling [[chariot]]s. Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period. Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys&amp;nbsp;— for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made.&lt;ref name=forti/&gt; They are used as a measure of wealth in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:43,&lt;ref name=genesis/&gt; and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of [[Shechem]] (the modern [[Nablus]]) is named Hamor ("donkey" in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=gen34/&gt;

[[File:Piero di Cosimo - La Découverte du miel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Silenus on a donkey, detail from ''The Discovery of Honey'' (c. 1500) by [[Piero di Cosimo]]]]
According to Old Testament prophecy, the [[Messiah]] is said to arrive on a donkey: "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey!" ([[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9:9). According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled when [[Jesus]] entered [[Jerusalem]] riding on the animal ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 21:4-7, [[Gospel of John|John]] 12:14-15). Jesus appeared to be aware of this connection (Matthew 21:1-3, John 12:16).

In the [[Jewish]] religion, the donkey is not a [[kosher]] animal. In the [[Zohar]], it is considered ''avi avot hatuma'' or the ultimate impure animal, and doubly "[[Unclean animals|impure]]", as it is both non-ruminant and non-cloven hoofed. However, it is the only impure animal that falls under the [[mitzvah]] (commandment) of firstborn  ("[[bechor]]") consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals (See [[Petter Chamor]]). In Jewish [[Talmud|Oral Tradition]] ([[Talmud Bavli]]), the [[Messiah|son of David]] was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|tribes of Israel]] are undeserving of redemption.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;

In contemporary [[Israel]], the term "[[The Messiah's Donkey|Messiah's Donkey]]" (Chamoro Shel Mashiach חמורו של משיח) stands at the center of a controversial religious-political doctrine, under which it was the Heavenly-imposed "task" of secular [[Zionists]] to build up a [[Jewish State]], but once the state is established they are fated to give place to [[Orthodox Jews|the Religious]] who are ordained to lead the state. The secularists in this analogy are "The Donkey" while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective "Messiach". A book on the subject, published in 1998 by the militant secularist Sefi Rechlevsky, aroused a major controversy in the Israeli public opinion.&lt;ref name=wurm/&gt;

With the rise of Christianity, some believers came to see the cross-shaped marking present on donkeys' backs and shoulders as a symbol of the animal's bearing Jesus into [[Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]].  During the Middle Ages, Europeans used hairs from this cross (or contact with a donkey) as [[folk remedies]] to treat illness, including [[measles]] and [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref name=oliver/&gt; Around 1400 AD, one physician listed riding backwards on a donkey as a cure for [[scorpion]] stings.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

[[File:Kalratri Sanghasri 2010 Arnab Dutta.JPG|thumb|upright|Goddess [[Kalaratri]] rides a donkey.]]
Donkeys are also referred to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the [[Hinduism]], where the goddess [[Kalaratri]]'s [[vahana]] (vehicle) is a donkey.&lt;ref name=gaen/&gt; Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=muller/&gt; and the [[Panchatantra]].&lt;ref name=purn/&gt;

In Islam, eating the meat of a domestic donkey is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=86563 Eating meat of a donkey and giraffe]," [[IslamWeb.net]], 2003-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature and film===
Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the [[Bible]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys were found in the works of [[Homer]], [[Aesop]] and [[Apuleius]], where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the [[Proletariat|lower class]]. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's ''[[The Ass in the Lion's Skin]]'', representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow. [[Shakespeare]] popularized the use of the word "ass" as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600). In contrast, a few years later, [[Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' shows a more positive slant on the donkey, primarily as [[Sancho Panza]]'s mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility. They are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Balaam]]'s ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of [[Jesus]] riding into [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. [[William Wordsworth]] portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem ''[[Peter Bell (Wordsworth)|Peter Bell:A Tale]]'', using the donkey as a Christian symbol. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] in ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'' (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in [[Juan Ramon Jimenez]]'s ''[[Platero and I]].'' The melancholy [[Eeyore]] in ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;

Donkeys were featured in literature during the 20th century, including in [[George Orwell]]'s 1951 ''[[Animal Farm]]'', where [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] the donkey is portrayed as resilient and loyal.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt;  [[Puzzle (Narnia)|Puzzle]] is a well-meaning but easily manipulated donkey in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1956 ''[[The Last Battle]]''.&lt;ref name=mish/&gt; Brighty is the central character of the 1953 children's novel and 1967 film ''[[Brighty of the Grand Canyon]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  Donkeys are portrayed in film including the 1940 [[Disney]] film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', where the donkey is portrayed as a [[slapstick comedy|slapstick]] character who participates in a social faux pas with [[Bacchus]] and is punished by [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=clague/&gt; A donkey is featured as the main figure in the 1966 film ''[[Au hasard Balthazar]]'' by [[Robert Bresson]], and, is given a life path of Christian symbolism.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt; [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]], is featured as a main character in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' franchise of the 2000s.&lt;ref name=shrek/&gt;

===Colloquialisms, proverbs and insults===
Many cultures have colloquialisms and [[proverb]]s that include donkeys or asses. British phrases include "to talk the hind legs off a donkey", used to describe someone talking excessively and generally persuasively.&lt;ref name=davis/&gt; Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as "the donkey lets the rain soak him".&lt;ref name=ehren/&gt; The French philosopher [[Jean Buridan]] constructed the paradox called [[Buridan's ass]], in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst because he could not find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision.&lt;ref name=phrase/&gt; Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including "put your money in the ass of a donkey and they'll call him sir" (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and "women, donkeys and goats all have heads" (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats).&lt;ref name=melfi/&gt;  The United States developed its own expressions, including "better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me", "a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey", and "a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold", among others.&lt;ref name=meider/&gt; From Afghanistan, we find the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] proverb, "Even if a donkey goes to [[Mecca]], he is still a donkey." In Ethiopia, there are many [[Amharic]] proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, "The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart" (Bad company corrupts good morals).

The words "donkey" and "ass" (or translations thereof) have come to have derogatory or insulting meaning in several languages, and are generally used to mean someone who is obstinate, stupid or silly,&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict2/&gt;&lt;ref name=long/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfe/&gt; In [[football (soccer)|football]], especially in the United Kingdom, a player who is considered unskilful is often dubbed a "donkey",&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; and the term has a similar connotation in [[poker]].&lt;ref  name=bochan/&gt; In the US, the slang terms "dumbass" and "jackass" are used to refer to someone considered stupid.&lt;ref name=dict3/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict4/&gt;

===Politics===
[[File:The W(estminster) just-asses a braying - or - the downfall of the E. O. table by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|Satirical use of braying in a political cartoon]]
[[File:Democraticjackass.jpg|thumb|The [[Thomas Nast]] political cartoon that introduced the donkey as the mascot of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]]]
In keeping with their widespread cultural references, donkeys feature in political systems, symbols and terminology in many areas of the world. A "[[donkey vote]]" is a vote that simply writes down preferences in the order of the candidates (1 at the top, then 2, and so on), and is most often seen in countries with [[ranked voting systems]] and [[compulsory voting]], such as Australia.&lt;ref name=abc2/&gt; The donkey is a common symbol of the [[Democratic Party of the United States]], originating in a [[cartoon]] by [[Thomas Nast]] of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=nast/&gt;

The bray of the donkey may be used as a [[simile]] for loud and foolish speech in political [[Derision|mockery]].&lt;ref name=tel/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; For example,&lt;ref name=tryon/&gt;{{quote|There are braying men in the world as well as braying asses; for what's loud and senseless talking and swearing, any other than braying|[[Roger L'Estrange|Sir Roger L'Estrange]]}}
In 1963, [[Party of Donkeys]], a frivolous political party was founded in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Milani|first1=Abbas|title=Eminent Persians: The Men and Women who Made Modern Iran, 1941-1979|volume=1|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, N.Y.|isbn=978-0815609070|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "''ruc català''" or "''burro català''" ([[Catalan donkey]]) has become a [[Catalan symbols|symbol of Catalonia]] in Spain. In 2003 some friends in Catalonia made bumper stickers featuring the ''burro català'' as a reaction against a national advertising campaign for ''Toro d'Osborne'', a brandy. The burro became popular as a nationalist symbol in Catalonia, whose residents wanted to assert their identity to resist Spanish [[centralism]]. Renewed attention to the regional burro helped start a breeding campaign for its preservation, and its numbers have increased.&lt;ref name=mont/&gt;

[[Proshka]], an ass owned by Russian populist nationalist liberal democratic politician [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], became prominent during the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 Russian presidential election]] campaign, when he was filmed in an election advertisement video. In that controversial ad, Zhirinovsky appeared sitting in a [[sleigh]] harnessed with Proshka, then claiming that the "little wretched ass" is the symbol of Russia and that if he would become [[President of Russia|President]] a "daring [[troika harness|troika]]" would return as a [[List of cultural icons of Russia|symbol of Russia]] instead of the ass; at the end, Zhirinovsky beat Proshka with a [[whip]], made the ass move and had a ride on him through the snow-covered backyard of his [[dacha]]. International organisations [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and [[World Animal Protection]] have accused Zhirinovsky of [[cruelty to animals]]. Zhirinovsky replied to the assertions by stating that similar treatment is commonplace in the [[Arab world]] and claimed that his ass has been treated "better than many people".&lt;ref name=ass-defenders&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr2.ru/election/371706.html|title=Страница не найдена|publisher=|access-date=March 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165143/http://www.nr2.ru/election/371706.html|archive-date=May 16, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cama''' is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a male [[dromedary]] camel and a female [[llama]], and has been produced via [[artificial insemination]] at the Camel Reproduction Centre in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/49301.stm |title=Meet Rama the cama ... BBC |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-01-21 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first cama was born on January 14, 1998. The aim was to create an animal capable of higher wool production than the llama, with the size and strength of a camel and a cooperative temperament.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;

==Breeding==
An adult dromedary camel can weigh up to six times as much as a llama, so the hybrid needs to be produced by artificial insemination. Insemination of a female llama with sperm from a male dromedary camel has been the only successful combination. Inseminating a female camel with llama sperm has not produced viable offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Cama' camel/llama hybrids born in UAE research centre|url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/2002/03/21/emirates-cama/|first=Miral|last=Fahmy|date=21 March 2002|accessdate=28 November 2012|work=Science in the News|publisher=The Royal Society of New Zealand|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927105152/http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/2002/03/21/emirates-cama/|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xanadu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xanadufarms.com/Stories/the_cama.htm |title=Xanadu Farms |publisher=Xanadu Farms |date=2002-02-27 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cama showed signs of becoming sexually mature at age four, when he showed a desire to breed with a female [[guanaco]] and a female llama. He was also a behavioral disappointment, displaying an extremely poor temperament. A more recent story suggests that his behavior is generally more gentle, as was hoped for.&lt;ref name="xanadu" /&gt; The second cama, a female named Kamilah, was successfully born in 2002. As of April 2008, five camas have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.impactlab.net/2008/04/08/world%e2%80%99s-first-camel-and-llama-cross-now-has-friends/ |title=World’s First Camel And Llama Cross Now Has Friends |publisher=Impactlab.net |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722125038/http://www.impactlab.net/2008/04/08/world%E2%80%99s-first-camel-and-llama-cross-now-has-friends/ |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food and drink==
Much like camels, camas are herbivores that eat shrubs and other plant matter. As they can drink large amounts of water at a time, camas can survive with little or no water for long periods.

==Comparison of camelids==
The camelid family consists of the Old World camelids (the dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, and [[Wild Bactrian camel|wild Bactrian camels]]) and the New World camelids (the llama, [[vicuna]], suri [[alpaca]], huacaya alpaca, and [[guanaco]]). Though there have been successful and fertile hybrids within both major groups of camelids, the cama marks the first instance of cross-breeding. The following is a table comparing some of the characteristics of camelids.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Book Encyclopedia|year=1998|publisher=World Book|isbn=0-7166-0098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great Book of the Animal Kingdom|year=1993|publisher=Crescent Books|location=New York|isbn=0-517-08801-0|pages=328–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Camels and Relatives, Animal The Definitive Visual Guide to the World’s Wildlife|first=Dorling|last=Kindersley|year=2005|isbn= 0-7894-7764-5|pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lowland paca''' (''Cuniculus paca''), also known as the '''spotted paca''', is a large rodent found in [[tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[Americas|America]], from East-Central [[Mexico]] to Northern [[Argentina]]. Introduced to [[Cuba]], [[Bahamas]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, J. L. (2003). Introduced Mammals of the World: Their History, Distribution and Influence. Csiro Publishing, Collingwood, Australia. {{ISBN|9780643099166}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The animal is called '''''paca''''' in most of its range, but '''''tepezcuintle'''''  in most of [[Mexico]] and Central America, '''''pisquinte''''' in northern Costa Rica, '''''jaleb''''' in the Yucatán peninsula, '''''conejo pintado''''' in [[Panama]], '''''guanta''''' in [[Ecuador]],  '''''majás''''' or '''''picuro''''' in [[Peru]], '''''jochi pintado''''' in [[Bolivia]], and '''''boruga''''',&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=9r9E_HBDAF0C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=paca+boruga&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iJKf7_ZRwz&amp;sig=85N_UMlVKN-zmNktvXgJiSEuq_o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LhGlTOGcOo6ssAOQ6tn-Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paca%20boruga&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; '''''tinajo''''',&lt;ref name=HumboldtLebrija&gt;{{es}} [http://i2d.humboldt.org.co/ceiba/resource.do?r=rionegro_faunaflora_2014 Fauna y flora de la cuenca media del Río Lebrija en Rionegro, Santander] - [[Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute|Humboldt Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''guartinaja''''' in [[Colombia]]. It is also known as the '''''gibnut''''' in [[Belize]], where it is prized as a [[game animal]], '''''labba''''' in [[Guyana]], '''''lapa''''' in Venezuela, and '''''lappe''''' on the island of [[Trinidad]]. Although lowland pacas are not in danger of being extinct, local extinctions have occurred due to habitat destructions.

There is much confusion in the nomenclature of this and related species; see [[agouti]]. In particular, the popular term ''agouti'' or ''common agouti'' normally refers to species of the distinct  genus ''[[Dasyprocta]]'' (such as the [[Central American agouti]], ''Dasyprocta punctata''). Sometimes the word ''agouti'' is also used for a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] grouping uniting the families [[Cuniculidae]] and [[Dasyproctidae]], which, besides the pacas and common agoutis, includes also the [[acouchi]]s (''Myoprocta''). ''Cuniculus'' is the appropriate genus name instead of ''Agouti'' based on a 1998 ruling of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] as the lowland paca's genus.&lt;ref name=msw3_2&gt;{{MSW3 Woods|id=13400269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "paca" comes from a word in the [[Tupi language]] that designates the animal but also means "awaken, alert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlcv/tupi/vocabulario.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809053512/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlcv/tupi/vocabulario.htm |archivedate=2012-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FERREIRA, A. B. H. ''Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa''. Segunda edição. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 1986. p. 1 243&lt;/ref&gt;
"Tepezcuintle" is of [[Nahuatl]] origin, meaning mountain dog: ''tepetl'' = mountain; ''itzquintli'' = dog.

== Description ==
[[File:Die vergleichende Osteologie (1821) Cuniculus paca.jpg|thumb|Skeleton]]
The lowland paca has coarse fur without underfur, dark brown to black on the upper body and white or yellowish on the underbelly. It usually has three to five rows of white spots along its sides, against a dark grey background. It has thick strong legs, with four digits in the forefeet and five in the hind feet (the first and fifth are reduced); the nails function as hooves. The tail is short and hairless. The [[zygomatic arch]] is expanded laterally and dorsally and is used as a resonating chamber - a unique feature among mammals.

An adult lowland paca weighs between {{convert|6|and|12|kg|lb}}. While their fertility is low, the lowland pacas no trouble surviving. Each litter has one young lowland paca, sometimes two. They usually have one to three young a year with a gestation period of about 115–120 days. Pacas are sexually mature at about 1 year. A paca usually lives up to 13 years.

The lowland paca can carry [[leishmaniasis]] and [[trypanosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-2.RLTS.T699A22197347.en|title=Cuniculus paca: Emmons, L.|date=2016-03-01|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|doi=10.2305/iucn.uk.2016-2.rlts.t699a22197347.en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habits ==
[[File:HumedoTepezc 02.jpg|thumb|Lowland pacas feeding on fruits]]

The lowland paca is mostly nocturnal and solitary and does not vocalize very much. It lives in forested habitats near water, preferably smaller rivers, and dig simple burrows about 2 m (6&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in) below the surface, usually with more than one exit. It can also sometimes live in burrows created by other animals. The lowland paca is a good swimmer and usually heads for the water to escape danger, as it can stay under water for several minutes. It also is a very good climber and it searches for fruit in the trees. 

The lowland paca can be considered an important seed distributor, since its diet includes leaves, stems, roots, seeds, and fruit, especially [[avocado]]s, [[mango]]s and [[zapote]]s. It sometimes stores food.

== Economical and ecological aspects ==
The lowland paca is considered an agricultural pest for [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], [[sugar cane]], [[corn]] and other food crops. Its meat is highly prized. It is plentiful in protected habitats, and hence not in danger of extinction, but overall its numbers have been much reduced because of hunting and habitat destruction. It is easily bred and raised in farms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Domestication and husbandry of the paca (Agouti paca)|year=1995|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=9789251036402}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the taste is said to be inferior (perhaps unpleasant) when farmed. Some of the lowland paca predators include cats, coyotes, bush dogs, crocodiles, and boa constrictors.

[[File:New Forest calf.jpg|thumb|A calf in the [[New Forest]], [[England]]]]
A '''calf''' (plural, '''calves''') is the young of domestic [[cattle]]. Calves are reared to become adult cattle, or are slaughtered for their meat, called [[veal]], and for their [[calfskin]].

The term "calf" is also used for some other species. See "[[#Other animals|Other animals]]" below.

== Terminology ==
[[File:Cow giving birth, in Laos (step by step).jpg|thumb|Calving (step by step)]]
&lt;!-- "Poddy calf" redirects to this section heading. If this heading changes please also change the redirect to reflect this. TIA. --&gt;
"Calf" is the term used from birth to [[weaning]], when it becomes known as a ''weaner'' or ''weaner calf'', though in some areas the term "calf" may be used until the animal is a [[wikt:yearling|yearling]]. The birth of a calf is known as ''calving''. A calf that has lost its mother is an orphan calf, also known as a ''poddy'' or ''poddy-calf'' in British English. ''Bobby calves'' are young calves which are to be slaughtered for human consumption.&lt;ref name="Mac"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Macquarie Dictionary |last= |year=1991|publisher= Macquarie Library |location=North Ryde }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''vealer'' is a fat calf weighing less than about {{Convert|330|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} which is at about eight to nine months of age.&lt;ref&gt;The Land, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSW, 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A young female calf from birth until she has had a calf of her own is called a ''heifer''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webster.com/dictionary/heifer| title = Definition of heifer| accessdate = 2006-11-29|author = | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = | year = | month = | work = | publisher = Merriam-Webster| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|f|ər}}). In the [[American Old West]], a motherless or small, runty calf was sometimes referred to as a ''dogie,'' (pronounced with a long "o")&lt;!--can someone do IPA for that?--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vAr2T4Bh7nkC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=dogie+calf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yO8jaxSYxy&amp;sig=vx1qnYDnNbpRsJiGRDppFRZd0X8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2x0oSszoFNDflQfek_HWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Cassidy, Frederic Gomes, and  Joan Houston Hall.

The term "calf" is also used for some other species. See "[[#Other animals|Other animals]]" below.

== Early development ==
[[File:Veau nouveau-nébis.jpg|thumb|Newborn calf.]]
[[File:Embryo transfered calves.JPG|thumb|[[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] calves which were transferred, as embryos, into their [[Angus cattle|Angus]] and Hereford recipient mothers.]]
Calves may be produced by natural means, or by artificial breeding using [[artificial insemination]] or [[embryo transfer]].&lt;ref name="Friend"&gt;Friend, John B., Cattle of the World, Blandford Press, Dorset, 1978, {{ISBN|0-7137-0856-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calves are born after a [[gestation]] of nine months. They usually stand within a few minutes of calving, and suckle within an hour. However, for the first few days they are not easily able to keep up with the rest of the herd, so young calves are often left hidden by their mothers, who visit them several times a day to suckle them. By a week old the calf is able to follow the mother all the time.

Some calves are [[ear tag]]ged soon after birth, especially those that are [[Stud_(animal)|stud cattle]] in order to correctly identify their dams (mothers), or in areas (such as the [[European Union|EU]]) where tagging is a legal requirement for cattle. A calf must have the very best of everything until it is at least eight months old if it is to reach its maximum potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beattie |first= William A. |coauthors= |title= Beef Cattle Breeding &amp; Management |publisher= Popular Books, Frenchs Forest |year= 1990 |month= |isbn= 0-7301-0040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically when the calves are about two months old they are branded, ear marked, castrated and [[vaccinate]]d.

== Calf rearing systems ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}
The ''single suckler'' system of rearing calves is similar to that occurring naturally in wild cattle, where each calf is suckled by its own mother until it is weaned at about nine months old. This system is commonly used for rearing [[beef cattle]] throughout the world.

Cows kept on poor forage (as is typical in [[subsistence farming]]) produce a limited amount of milk. A calf left with such a mother all the time can easily drink all the milk, leaving none for human consumption. For dairy production under such circumstances, the calf's access to the cow must be limited, for example by penning the calf and bringing the mother to it once a day after partly milking her. The small amount of milk available for the calf under such systems may mean that it takes a longer time to rear, and in subsistence farming it is therefore common for cows to calve only in alternate years.

In more intensive [[dairy farming]], cows can easily be bred and fed to produce far more milk than one calf can drink. In the ''multi-suckler'' system, several calves are fostered onto one cow in addition to her own, and these calves' mothers can then be used wholly for milk production. More commonly, calves of dairy cows are fed formula milk from a bottle or bucket from soon after birth.

Purebred female calves of [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] are reared as replacement dairy cows. Most purebred dairy calves are produced by artificial insemination (AI). By this method each bull can serve very many cows, so only a very few of the purebred dairy male calves are needed to provide bulls for breeding. The remainder of the male calves may be reared for beef or veal; however, some extreme dairy breeds carry so little muscle that rearing the purebred male calves may be uneconomic, and in this case they are often killed soon after birth and disposed of. Only a proportion of purebred heifers are needed to provide replacement cows, so often some of the cows in dairy herds are put to a beef bull to produce crossbred calves suitable for rearing as beef.

Veal calves may be reared entirely on milk formula and killed at about 18 or 20 weeks as "white" veal, or fed on grain and hay and killed at 22 to 35 weeks to produce red or pink veal.

== Growth ==
[[File:Vaca.JPG|thumb|[[Ear tag]]ged calf and cow in [[Andorra]].]]
[[File:Calf suckling at a meadow near Vrachesh, Bulgaria.webm|thumb|Video of calf suckling in [[Bulgaria]]]]
A commercial steer or bull calf is expected to put on about {{Convert|32|to|36|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} per month. A nine-month-old steer or bull is therefore expected to weigh about {{Convert|250|to|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Heifers will weigh at least {{Convert|200|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at eight months of age.

Calves are usually weaned at about eight to nine months of age, but depending on the season and condition of the dam, they might be weaned earlier. They may be paddock weaned, often next to their mothers, or weaned in [[Feedlot|stockyards]]. The latter system is preferred by some as it accustoms the weaners to the presence of people and they are trained to take feed other than grass.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cole B.V.Sc. |first= V.G. |coauthors= |title= Beef Production Guide |publisher= Macarthur Press, Parramatta |year= 1978 |month= |isbn= 0-9599973-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small numbers may also be weaned with their dams with the use of weaning [[nose ring (animals)|nose rings]] or nosebands which results in the mothers rejecting the calves' attempts to suckle. Many calves are also weaned when they are taken to the large weaner [[auction]] sales that are conducted in the south eastern states of Australia. Victoria and [[New South Wales]] have yardings{{clarify|post-text=Please explain yardings|date=April 2011}} of up to 8,000 weaners (calves) for [[auction]] sale in one day.&lt;ref&gt;The Land, 16 April 2009, "CTLX Carcoar Blue Ribbon Weaner Sale", p. 13, Rural Press, North Richmond&lt;/ref&gt; The best of these weaners may go to the butchers. Others will be purchased by re-stockers to grow out and fatten on grass or as potential breeders. In the United States these weaners may be known as ''feeders'' and would be placed directly into [[feedlot]]s.

At about 12 months old a beef heifer reaches puberty if she is well grown.&lt;ref name="Cole" /&gt;

== Diseases ==
Calves suffer from few congenital abnormalities but the [[Akabane virus]] is widely distributed in [[temperate]] to [[Tropics|tropical]] regions of the world. The virus is a teratogenic pathogen which causes [[abortion]]s, stillbirths, premature births and congenital abnormalities, but occurs only during some years.

== Uses ==
Calf meat for [[human]] consumption is called [[veal]], and is usually produced from the male calves of [[Dairy cattle]].  Also eaten are [[calf's brains]] and [[calf liver]]. The [[Hide (skin)|hide]] is used to make [[calfskin]], or tanned into leather and called calf leather, or sometimes in the US "novillo", the Spanish term. The fourth compartment of the stomach of slaughtered milk-fed calves is the source of [[rennet]]. The [[intestine]] is used to make [[Goldbeater's skin]], and is the source of [[Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP)]].

Dairy cows can only produce milk after having calved, and dairy cows need to produce one calf each year in order to remain in production. Female calves will become a replacement dairy cow.  Male dairy calves are generally reared for beef or veal, relatively few are kept for breeding purposes.

== Other animals ==
{{See also|List of animal names}}
In [[English language|English]] the term "calf" is used by extension for the young of various other large species of [[mammal]]. In addition to other [[Bovinae|bovid]] species (such as [[bison]], [[yak]] and [[water buffalo]]), these include the young of [[camel]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, larger deer (such as [[moose]], [[elk]] (wapiti) and [[red deer]]), [[rhinoceros]]es, [[porpoise]]s, [[whale]]s, [[walrus]]es and larger [[Pinniped|seals]]. However, common domestic species tend to have their own specific names, such as [[foal]] and lamb.

It is an [[odd-toed ungulate]] [[mammal]] belonging to the taxonomic family [[Equidae]]. The horse has [[evolution of the horse|evolved]] over the past 45 to 55&amp;nbsp;million years from a small multi-toed creature, ''[[Eohippus]]'', into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began [[Domestication|domesticating]] horses around 4000 BC, and their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]] is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies ''caballus'' are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as [[feral horse]]s. These feral populations are not true [[wild horse]]s, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered [[Przewalski's horse]], a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true [[wild horse]]. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from [[equine anatomy|anatomy]] to life stages, size, [[equine coat color|colors]], [[horse markings|markings]], [[horse breed|breeds]], [[horse gait|locomotion]], and behavior.

Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed [[Equilibrioception|sense of balance]] and a strong [[fight-or-flight response]]. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/learn-how-all-horses-sleep-1887328|title=Do You Know How Horses Sleep?|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female horses, called [[mare]]s, carry their young for approximately 11&amp;nbsp;months, and a young horse, called a [[foal]], can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under [[saddle]] or in [[Horse harness|harness]] between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&amp;nbsp;years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as [[draft horse]]s and some [[Pony|ponies]], suitable for slow, heavy work; and "[[warmblood]]s", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300&amp;nbsp;breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.

Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as [[Mounted police|police work]], [[working animal|agriculture]], entertainment, and [[hippotherapy|therapy]]. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[driving (horse)|driving]] techniques developed, using many different styles of [[Horse tack|equipment]] and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as [[veterinarian]]s and [[farrier]]s.

Specific terms and specialized language are used to describe [[equine anatomy]], different life stages, colors and breeds.

===Lifespan and life stages===
Depending on breed, [[horse management|management]] and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Ensminger46/&gt; Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|title=The Age of a Horse|publisher=Government of Ontario|website=Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs|author=Wright, B.|date=March 29, 1999|accessdate=2009-10-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120031232/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_age.htm|archivedate=January 20, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest verifiable record was "[[Old Billy]]", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.&lt;ref name=Ensminger46/&gt; In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9708|title= World's Oldest Living Pony Dies at 56|accessdate=2007-05-31 |author= Ryder, Erin |website= The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:

* [[Foal]]: A foal of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a ''suckling'' and a foal that has been weaned is called a ''weanling''.&lt;ref name=Ensminger418&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yearling (horse)|Yearling]]: A horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 430&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Colt (horse)|Colt]]: A male horse under the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Becker, Marty |author2=Pavia,Audrey |author3= Spadafori, Gina |author4=Becker, Teresa |title=Why Do Horses Sleep Standing Up?: 101 of the Most Perplexing Questions Answered About Equine Enigmas, Medical Mysteries, and Befuddling Behaviors|publisher=HCI|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7573-0608-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qvz62nMkQLYC&amp;pg=PA23|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Filly]]: A female horse under the age of four.&lt;ref name=Ensminger418/&gt;
* [[Mare]]: A female horse four years old and older.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stallion]]: A non-castrated male horse four years old and older.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; The term "horse" is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.&lt;ref name=Ensminger420&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gelding]]: A [[castration|castrated]] male horse of any age.&lt;ref name=Ensminger418/&gt;

In [[horse racing]], these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, [[Thoroughbred]] horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.equibase.com/newfan/glossary-full.cfm|title= Glossary of Horse Racing Terms|accessdate=2008-04-03 |website= Equibase.com|publisher= Equibase Company, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studbook.org.au/DisplayPDF.aspx?ty=RULES|title=Rules of the Australian Stud Book|accessdate=2010-02-05|page=9|date=July 2008|publisher=Australian Jockey Club Ltd and Victoria Racing Club Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size and measurement===
The height of horses is usually measured at the highest point of the [[withers]], where the neck meets the [[back (horse)|back]].&lt;ref name=Whitaker77&gt;[[#Whitaker|Whitaker]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.

In English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of [[Hand (length)|hands]] and inches: one hand is equal to {{convert|101.6|mm|in|0|order=flip}}. The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a [[radix point|point]], then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high"). Thus, a horse described as "15.2 h" is 15 hands plus 2&amp;nbsp;inches, for a total of {{convert|62|in|cm|1}} in height.&lt;ref name=Ensminger51&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horse-and-pony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and small pony.|alt=A large brown horse is chasing a small horse in a pasture.]]
The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by [[equine nutrition|nutrition]]. Light riding horses usually range in height from {{hands|14|to|16|lk=off}} and can weigh from {{convert|380|to|550|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entries 1, 68, 69&lt;/ref&gt; Larger riding horses usually start at about {{hands|15.2|lk=off}} and often are as tall as {{hands|17|lk=off}}, weighing from {{convert|500|to|600|kg|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entries 12, 30, 31, 32, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy or [[draft horse]]s are usually at least {{hands|16|lk=off}} high and can be as tall as {{hands|18|lk=off}} high. They can weigh from about {{convert|700|to|1000|kg|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entries 86, 96, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a [[Shire horse]] named [[Sampson (horse)|Mammoth]], who was born in 1848. He stood {{hands|21.2+1/4|lk=off}} high and his peak weight was estimated at {{convert|1524|kg}}.&lt;ref name=Whitaker60&gt;[[#Whitaker|Whitaker]], p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is [[Thumbelina (horse)|Thumbelina]], a fully mature [[miniature horse]] affected by [[dwarfism]]. She is {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} tall and weighs {{convert|57|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409317&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=Meet Thumbelina, the World's Smallest Horse |accessdate=2006-10-08 |author= Martin, Arthur |work= Daily Mail | location=London | date=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ponies====
{{Main|Pony}}
Ponies are [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of [[phenotype]], including conformation and temperament.

The traditional standard for height of a horse or a [[pony]] at maturity is {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}. An animal 14.2&amp;nbsp;h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2&amp;nbsp;h a pony,&lt;ref name=EnsmingerHT11&gt;{{cite book |author= Ensminger, M.E.|title= Horses and Tack|edition= Revised|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company|location= Boston, MA|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0-395-54413-6 |oclc= 21561287|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under {{hands|14|lk=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howlett, Lorna  |author2=Philip Mathews|title=Ponies in Australia|publisher=Philip Mathews Publishers|location=Milson's Point, NSW|isbn=978-0-908001-13-2|year=1979|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For competition in the [[western riding|Western]] division of the [[United States Equestrian Federation]], the cutoff is {{hands|14.1|lk=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usef.org/_IFrames/RuleBook/rulebooks.aspx |title=2012 United States Equestrian Federation, Inc. Rule Book |publisher=United States Equestrian Federation |page=Rule WS 101 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415003731/http://www.usef.org/_IFrames/RuleBook/rulebooks.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]], the world governing body for horse sport, uses [[metric system|metric]] measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than {{convert|148|cm|in|2}} at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.2 h, and {{convert|149|cm|in|2}}, or just over 14.2½ h, with shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/Annex%20XVII%20-%20Extracts%20Ponies.pdf | title=Annex XVII: Extracts from Rules for Pony Riders and Children, 9th edition | publisher=Fédération Equestre Internationale | year=2009 | accessdate=2010-03-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911122158/http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/Annex%20XVII%20-%20Extracts%20Ponies.pdf | archivedate=2012-09-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. [[Breed registry|Breed registries]] for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2&amp;nbsp;h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Missouri Fox Trotter]], or the [[Arabian horse]]. See [[#McBane|McBane]], pp. 192, 218&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2&amp;nbsp;h, but are still considered to be ponies.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[Welsh Pony]]. See [[#McBane|McBane]], pp. 52–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.&lt;ref name=EnsmingerHT11/&gt; Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the [[Shetland pony]] which averages {{hands|10|lk=off}}, is considered a pony.&lt;ref name=EnsmingerHT11/&gt; Conversely, breeds such as the [[Falabella]] and other [[miniature horse]]s, which can be no taller than {{convert|30|in|cm}}, are classified by their [[breed registry|registries]] as very small horses, not ponies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McBane|McBane]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses exhibit a diverse array of [[Equine coat color|coat colors]] and distinctive [[horse markings|markings]], described by a specialized vocabulary.

Many [[Equine coat color genetics|genes]] that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different [[allele]]s influencing coat color,&lt;ref name=UCVGL/&gt; and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] and [[black (horse)|black]] are determined by the [[gene]] controlled by the [[Melanocortin 1 receptor]],&lt;ref name=Marklund1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marklund |first=L. |author2=M.

Horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks "white" is usually a middle-aged or older [[gray (horse)|gray]]. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white [[horse markings|markings]]). The only horses properly called [[white (horse)|white]] are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.&lt;ref name=UCDIntro&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php|title= Introduction to Coat Color Genetics|accessdate=2008-05-01|website= Veterinary Genetics Laboratory |publisher= University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different and unrelated [[Genetics|genetic]] factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of [[dominant white]] and the [[sabino horse|sabino-1 gene]].&lt;ref name=haase2009-similar&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haase B |title=Allelic Heterogeneity at the Equine KIT Locus in Dominant White (W) Horses |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e195 |year=2007 |pmid=17997609 |pmc=2065884 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030195 |author2=Brooks SA |author3=Schlumbaum A |display-authors=3 |last4=Azor |first4=Pedro J. |last5=Bailey |first5=Ernest |last6=Alaeddine |first6=Ferial |last7=Mevissen |first7=Meike |last8=Burger |first8=Dominik |last9=Poncet |first9=Pierre-André}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no "[[Albinism|albino]]" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.&lt;ref name=Duplicatetest&gt;{{cite journal |title= Genetic mapping of dominant white (W), a homozygous lethal condition in the horse (''Equus caballus'') |author1= Mau, C. |author2= Poncet, P.

[[Gestation]] lasts approximately 340&amp;nbsp;days, with an average range 320–370 days,&lt;ref name=Ensminger156&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; and usually results in one [[foal]]; twins are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.okstate.edu/pio/twinfoals.html|accessdate=2008-09-23|title=Rare Twin Foals Born at Vet Hospital: Twin Birth Occurrences Number One in Ten Thousand| author=Johnson, Tom|website= Communications Services, Oklahoma State University|publisher= Oklahoma State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses are a [[precocial]] species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Miller, Robert M.  |author2=Rick Lamb|title=Revolution in Horsemanship and What it Means to Mankind |publisher= Lyons Press|location=Guilford, Connecticut|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59228-387-3 |oclc=57005594|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foals are usually born in the spring. The [[estrous cycle]] of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an ''anestrus'' period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.&lt;ref name=Ensminger150&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Foals are generally [[weaning|weaned]] from their mothers between four and six months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/29352/reducing-weaning-stress-in-foals|author=Kline, Kevin H.|title=Reducing weaning stress in foals|publisher=Montana State University eXtension|date=2010-10-07|accessdate=2012-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322182958/http://www.extension.org/pages/29352/reducing-weaning-stress-in-foals|archivedate=2012-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18&amp;nbsp;months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.&lt;ref name=HorseTack129&gt;{{cite book |author= Ensminger, M.E.|title= Horses and Tack|edition= Revised|publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company|location= Boston, MA|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0-395-54413-6 |oclc= 21561287|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form [[Osseous tissue|bone tissue]], but the [[epiphyseal plate]]s are larger and take longer to convert from [[cartilage]] to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equineortho.colostate.edu/questions/dod.htm |title=Developmental Orthopaedic Disease: Problems of Limbs in young Horses|accessdate=2008-04-20|author= McIlwraith, C.W.|publisher=Colorado State University|website=Orthopaedic Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and [[horse training|trained]] to be ridden between the ages of two and four.&lt;ref name=Train163&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas, Heather Smith |title=Storey's Guide to Training Horses: Ground Work, Driving, Riding |publisher=Storey Publishing |location=North Adams, MA |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58017-467-1|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|race horses]] are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jockeyclub.com/factbook.asp?section=11|title= 2-Year-Old Racing (US and Canada)|accessdate=2008-04-28 |website= Online Fact Book|publisher= Jockey Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; horses specifically bred for sports such as [[dressage]] are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The USDF Guide to Dressage|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9NNobNYAiroC&amp;pg=PA272|author1=Bryant, Jennifer Olson  |author2=George Williams|publisher=Storey Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1-58017-529-6|pages=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[endurance riding]] competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60&amp;nbsp;calendar months (five years) old.&lt;ref name=Endurance/&gt;

===Anatomy===
{{Main|Equine anatomy|Muscular system of the horse|Respiratory system of the horse|Circulatory system of the horse}}

====Skeletal system====
{{Main|Skeletal system of the horse}}
[[File:Horse anatomy.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|The skeletal system of a modern horse|alt=Diagram of a horse skeleton with major parts labeled.]]
The horse skeleton averages 205 bones.&lt;ref name=Evans90&gt;{{cite book |author= Evans, J.|title= The Horse|edition= Second|publisher= Freeman|location= New York, NY|year= 1990|isbn=978-0-7167-1811-6 |oclc= 20132967|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a [[Clavicle|collarbone]]—the horse's [[Equine forelimb anatomy|forelimbs]] are attached to the [[Vertebral column|spinal column]] by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the [[Scapula|shoulder blade]] to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the [[Carpus|carpal]] bones that correspond to the human [[wrist]]. Similarly, the [[hock (zoology)|hock]] contains bones equivalent to those in the human [[ankle]] and [[heel]]. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the [[Equine anatomy|fetlock]] (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal [[sesamoid bone]]s between the [[Equine anatomy|cannon]] bones (a single equivalent to the human [[Metacarpus|metacarpal]] or [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bones) and the [[proximal phalanges]], located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, [[tendon]]s, [[ligament]]s, [[cartilage]], and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the [[horse hoof|hoof]].&lt;ref name=Ensminger21&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hooves====
{{Main|Horse hoof|Horseshoe|Farrier}}

The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".&lt;ref name=Ensminger367&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; The [[horse hoof]] begins with the [[distal phalanges]], the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by [[cartilage]] and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the [[Horse hoof#Internal structures|laminae]]. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of [[keratin]], the same material as a human [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is that a horse, weighing on average {{convert|500|kg}},&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 457&lt;/ref&gt; travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118|title= Yes, The Shin Bone Is Connected to the Ankle Bone|accessdate=2008-04-05 |author= Fuess, Theresa A.|website= Pet Column|publisher= University of Illinois |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161307/http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle_pf.cfm?id=118 |archivedate = September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have [[horseshoe]]s placed on their feet by a professional [[farrier]]. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], pp. 310–312&lt;/ref&gt; though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.

====Teeth====
{{Main|Horse teeth}}

Horses are adapted to [[grazing]]. In an adult horse, there are 12&amp;nbsp;[[incisor]]s at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24&amp;nbsp;teeth adapted for chewing, the [[premolar]]s and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]], at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] called "tushes". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] teeth in front of the molars, known as "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the [[bit (horse)|bit]]. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or "bars" of the horse's mouth when the horse is [[bridle]]d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kreling |first=Kai |title=Horses' Teeth and Their Problems: Prevention, Recognition, and Treatment |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=3q1LINmOkOIC&amp;pg=PA117-IA1 |year=2005 |publisher=Globe Pequot |location=Guilford, CT |isbn=978-1-59228-696-6 |chapter=The Horse's Teeth |oclc=59163221|pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.&lt;ref name=Ensminger46&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 46–50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Digestion====
{{Main|Equine anatomy#Digestive system|Equine nutrition|l1=Equine digestive system}}
Horses are [[herbivore]]s with a digestive system adapted to a [[forage]] diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A {{convert|450|kg|adj=on}} horse will eat {{convert|7|to|11|kg}} of food per day and, under normal use, drink {{convert|38|to|45|L}} of [[water]]. Horses are not [[ruminant]]s, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize [[cellulose]], a major component of grass. Horses are [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]]. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the [[cecum]], or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the [[large intestine]]. Horses cannot [[Vomiting|vomit]], so digestion problems can quickly cause [[horse colic|colic]], a leading cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Giffin|Giffin]], p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senses====
[[File:Pferdeauge.jpg|thumb|A horse's eye|alt=Close up of a horse eye, with is dark brown with lashes on the top eyelid]]
{{See also|Equine vision}}
The horses' senses are based on their status as [[predation|prey animals]], where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.&lt;ref name=Ensminger309&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 309–310&lt;/ref&gt; They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,&lt;ref name=Sellnow&gt;{{cite book|author=Sellnow, Les|title=Happy Trails: Your Complete Guide to Fun and Safe Trail Riding|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bOUTZgrGD6QC&amp;pg=PA46|year=2004|publisher=Eclipse Press|isbn=978-1-58150-114-8|oclc=56493380|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15938 | title=Eye Position and Animal Agility Study Published|journal = The Horse | date =March 7, 2010 |nopp=|accessdate=2010-03-11}} Press Release, citing February 2010 Journal of Anatomy, Dr. Nathan Jeffery, co-author, University of Liverpool.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being [[binocular vision]] and the remaining 285° [[monocular vision]].&lt;ref name=Sellnow/&gt; Horses have excellent day and [[night vision]], but they have two-color, or [[Dichromacy|dichromatic vision]]; their [[color vision]] is somewhat like [[Red–green color blindness|red-green color blindness]] in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9670|title= In Living Color |registration=yes|accessdate=2007-07-27 |author= McDonnell, Sue |journal= The Horse |date= June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[Olfaction|sense of smell]], while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the [[Vomeronasal organ]]s, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze [[pheromones]].&lt;ref name="Briggs smell"&gt;{{cite web|last=Briggs|first=Karen|title=Equine Sense of Smell|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/10055/equine-sense-of-smell|publisher=The Horse|accessdate=2013-12-15|date=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A horse's hearing is good,&lt;ref name=Ensminger309/&gt; and the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, Jane |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-gAgchKMXdkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title= Horse Safe: A Complete Guide to Equine Safety |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location= Collingwood, UK|year=2005 |isbn=978-0-643-09245-7 |oclc=65466652|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music.

Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed [[proprioception]]—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/horse-health/1998/October/17/True-horse-sense.aspx|title= True Horse Sense|accessdate=2008-07-08 |author= Thomas, Heather Smith |website= Thoroughbred Times |publisher= Thoroughbred Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; A horse's [[Somatosensory system|sense of touch]] is well developed.

Horses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through [[fodder]] and choose what they would most like to eat,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; and their [[Prehensility|prehensile]] lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle.cfm?id=16|title= Horse Pasture is No Place for Poisonous Plants|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Gustavson, Carrie |website= Pet Column July 24, 2000 |publisher= University of Illinois |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070809051147/http://www.cvm.uiuc.edu/petcolumns/showarticle.cfm?id=16 |archivedate = August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Horse gait|Trot (horse gait)|Canter|Ambling}}

===Behavior===
{{Main|Horse behavior|Stable vices}}
Horses are prey animals with a strong [[fight-or-flight response]]. Their first reaction to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/23342/horse-fight-vs-flight-instinct |title=Horse Fight vs Flight Instinct |publisher=eXtension |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.&lt;ref name=Natural226&gt;{{cite book|ref=McBane |author= McBane, Susan|title= A Natural Approach to Horse Management|publisher= Methuen|location= London|year= 1992|isbn= 978-0-413-62370-6 |oclc= 26359746|pages= 226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses are [[herd animal]]s, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual [[Social grooming|grooming]], and [[body language]]. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.&lt;ref name=Ensminger305&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 305–309&lt;/ref&gt; However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop [[stable vices]], an assortment of bad habits, mostly [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]] of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.&lt;ref name=Prince214&gt;{{cite book |author1=Prince, Eleanor F.  |author2=Gaydell M.

====Intelligence and learning====
Studies have indicated that horses perform a number of [[Cognition|cognitive]] tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include [[foraging|food procurement]] and identification of individuals within a [[Social structure|social system]]. They also have good [[Spatial visualization ability|spatial discrimination]] abilities.&lt;ref name=Hanggi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/features/horseintelligence-119.shtml|title=Understanding horse intelligence|author=Clarkson, Neil|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2008-09-16|website=Horsetalk 2007|publisher=Horsetalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=True horsemanship through feel|last=Dorrance|first=Bill|publisher=The Lion Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-58574-321-6|location=Guilford, CT|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as [[problem solving]], speed of learning, and [[memory]]. Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve [[categorization]] and [[concept learning]]. They can learn using [[habituation]], [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]], [[classical conditioning]], and [[operant conditioning]], and positive and negative [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref name=Hanggi/&gt; One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between "more or less" if the quantity involved is less than four.&lt;ref name="count"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=15396 | title=Horses Demonstrate Ability to Count in New Study |author=Lesté-Lasserre, Christa |accessdate=2009-12-06|website=The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent [[instinct]]ive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural.&lt;ref name=Hanggi/&gt; Horses are animals of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/nicanor/archive/2008/06/17/equine-iq-what-big-brown-couldn-t-tell-you-and-mr-ed-kept-to-himself.aspx|title=What Big Brown Couldn't Tell You and Mr. Ed Kept to Himself (part 1)|author=Coarse, Jim|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-09-16|website=The Blood Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperament====&lt;!--[[cold blooded (horse)]] and [[hot blooded (horse)]] redirect to this section so if the section name is changed change the redirects--&gt;
{{Main|Draft horse|Warmblood|Oriental horse}}
Horses are [[mammal]]s, and as such are [[warm-blooded]], or [[endotherm]]ic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or [[poikilotherm]]ic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]. For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many [[horse racing|race horses]], exhibit more sensitivity and energy,&lt;ref name=Belknap255&gt;[[#Belknap|Belknap]], p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; while the "cold-bloods", such as most [[draft horse|draft breeds]], are quieter and calmer.&lt;ref name=Belknap112&gt;[[#Belknap|Belknap]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses",&lt;ref name=Ensminger71&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".&lt;ref name=Ensminger84&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hot blooded" breeds include "[[oriental horse]]s" such as the [[Akhal-Teke]], [[Arabian horse]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]] and now-extinct [[Turkoman horse]], as well as the [[Thoroughbred]], a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds.&lt;ref name=Belknap255/&gt; Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly.

Muscular, heavy [[draft horse]]s are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.&lt;ref name=Belknap112/&gt; They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".&lt;ref name=Catalog15&gt;[[#Price|Price]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known draft breeds include the [[Belgian (horse)|Belgian]] and the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]].&lt;ref name=Catalog15/&gt; Some, like the [[Percheron]], are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.&lt;ref name=Guide87&gt;[[#Bongianni|Bongianni]], entry 87&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the [[Shire horse|Shire]], are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.&lt;ref name=Ens124&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.&lt;ref name="Bennett7" /&gt;

"[[Warmblood]]" breeds, such as the [[Trakehner]] or [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]], developed when European carriage and [[horses in warfare|war horses]] were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[pony]] breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are the [[Australian Riding Pony]] and the [[Connemara pony|Connemara]], see [[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 178–179, 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; Warmbloods are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".&lt;ref name=Ensminger71/&gt;

Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down.

A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its [[instinct]]s are to keep a constant eye out for danger.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/&gt;

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|title= How Horses Sleep, Pt. 2&amp;nbsp;– Power Naps|accessdate= 2007-03-23|author= Pascoe, Elaine|website= Equisearch.com|date= 2002-03-12|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193158/http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/eqpowernap1771/|archivedate= 2007-09-27|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in short intervals of about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name=Ensminger310&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=40 Winks?|author=Holland, Jennifer S. |journal=National Geographic|volume=220|date=July 2011|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses must lie down to reach [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.&lt;ref name="Horse sleep pt. 2"/&gt; However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|title= Equine Sleep Disorder Videos|accessdate= 2007-03-23|author= EQUUS Magazine Staff|website= Equisearch.com|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070510051620/http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/behavior/sleepdisorder_121506/|archivedate= 2007-05-10|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition differs from [[narcolepsy]], although horses may also suffer from that disorder.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, BP |title=Large Animal Internal Medicine|publisher=Mosby|location=St. Louis, MO|year=1996 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-8151-7724-1 |oclc=33439780|pages= 1086–1087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, this order contained 14&amp;nbsp;[[Family (biology)|families]], but only three—[[Equidae]] (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the [[tapir]]), and Rhinocerotidae (the [[rhinoceros]]es)—have survived to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Perissodactyla.html|title= Order Perissodactyla|accessdate=2008-07-09 |author= Myers, Phil|website= Animal Diversity Web |publisher= University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known member of the family Equidae was the ''[[Hyracotherium]]'', which lived between 45 and 55&amp;nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Eocene]] period.

Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the [[steppe]]s of Eurasia and the [[Great Plains]] of North America.

By about 15,000 years ago, ''Equus ferus'' was a widespread [[holarctic]] species.

{{Main|Wild horse}}
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually [[feral horse]]s, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.&lt;ref name=Olsen46&gt;{{cite book |author= Olsen, Sandra L.|chapter=Horse Hunters of the Ice Age|title= Horses Through Time|edition= First|publisher= Roberts Rinehart Publishers|location= Boulder, CO |year= 1996 |isbn=978-1-57098-060-2 |oclc= 36179575|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two never-domesticated subspecies, the [[Tarpan]] and the [[Przewalski's Horse]], survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.

The [[Przewalski's horse]] (''Equus ferus przewalskii''), named after the Russian explorer [[Nikolai Przhevalsky]], is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; [[Mongolia]]n people know it as the ''taki'', and the [[Kyrgyz people]] call it a ''kirtag''. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zsl.org/about-us/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|title= An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse|date= 2005-12-19|accessdate= 2012-06-06|website= ZSL Press Releases|publisher= Zoological Society of London|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130516230420/http://www.zsl.org/about-us/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|archivedate= 2013-05-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.treemail.nl/takh/|title= Home|accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher= The Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dohner298&gt;[[#Dohner|Dohner]], pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.

The [[tarpan]] or European wild horse (''Equus ferus ferus'') was found in Europe and much of Asia.

Besides the horse, there are six other species of [[genus]] ''Equus'' in the Equidae [[family (biology)|family]]. These are the ass or [[donkey]], ''Equus asinus''; the [[mountain zebra]], ''Equus zebra''; [[plains zebra]], ''Equus quagga''; [[Grévy's Zebra|Grévy's zebra]], ''Equus grevyi''; the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang''; and the [[onager]], ''Equus hemionus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bucknell.edu/MSW3/browse.asp?id=14100020 |title=Equus hemionus |author=Pallas |year=1775 |website=Wilson &amp; Reeder's mammal species of the world |publisher=[[Bucknell University]] |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses can [[crossbreed]] with other members of their genus. The most common [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] is the [[mule]], a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a [[mare]].

==Domestication==
{{Main|History of horse domestication theories|Domestication of the horse}}
[[File:Bhimbetka rock paintng1.jpg|thumb|[[Bhimbetka rock shelters|Bhimbetka]] rock painting showing man riding on horse, India]]
Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on [[Paleontology|palaeological]] and [[archaeological]] discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.

The earliest archaeological evidence for the [[domestication of the horse]] comes from sites in [[Ukraine]] and [[Kazakhstan]], dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 19265018| year = 2009| author1 = Outram| first1 = A.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.&lt;ref name="Bennett7"&gt;{{cite book |author= Bennett, Deb|title= Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship|edition= First|publisher= Amigo Publications, Inc.|location= Solvang, CA|year= 1998 |isbn=978-0-9658533-0-9 |oclc= 39709067|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of [[selective breeding]] after domestication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Gladys Brown |title=The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse |publisher=Rich Publishing|year=1973 |edition=Revised Collectors |pages= 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of a detectable substructure &lt;!--huh? what's that?

There are also [[semi-feral]] horses in many parts of the world, such as [[Dartmoor]] and the [[New Forest]] in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in "wild" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmoorcommonerscouncil.org.uk/menu_page.php?id=53 |publisher=Dartmoor Commoners' Council|title=Animals on the Moor|accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fear75&gt;{{cite book |author=Fear, Sally|title=New Forest Drift: A Photographic Portrait of Life in the National Park|publisher= Perspective Photo Press|year= 2006|isbn=978-0-9553253-0-4|page= 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- could also include Carmarque horse of France and a lot of the big QH ranches in Texas--&gt;

===Breeds===
{{Main|Horse breed||List of horse breeds|Horse breeding}}

The concept of [[purebred]] bloodstock and a controlled, written [[breed registry]] has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds". [[Thoroughbred]] is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] recognized by a breed registry.&lt;ref name=Ensminger424&gt;[[#Ensminger|Ensminger]], p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as [[equine conformation|conformation]], color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and [[artificial selection]] methods. Horses have been [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] since their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]]. An early example of people who practiced selective [[horse breeding]] were the [[Bedouin]], who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their [[Arabian horse]]s and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Gladys Brown |title=The Arabian: War Horse to Show Horse |publisher=Rich Publishing|year=1973 |edition=Revised Collectors |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waho.org/History.html |title=Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=2008-04-29 |website=WAHO Publication Number 21 January 1998 |publisher=World Arabian Horse Organization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705105054/http://www.waho.org/Purityissue.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, [[Carthusian]] monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the [[Andalusian horse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|title= Andalusian |accessdate=2008-04-29|website= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061526/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|archivedate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.&lt;ref name=Sponenberg155&gt;[[#Sponenberg|Sponenberg]], p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for [[dressage]].&lt;ref name=Sponenberg155/&gt; Heavy draft horses developed out of a need to perform demanding [[farm]] work and pull heavy wagons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sponenberg|Sponenberg]], pp. 156–57&lt;/ref&gt; Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.&lt;ref name=Spon162&gt;[[#Sponenberg|Sponenberg]], p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sire]], or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was [[General Stud Book]] for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the [[foundation bloodstock]] for the breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp |title=History of Thoroughbreds |accessdate=2008-04-03 |website=Britishhorseracing.com |publisher=British Horseracing Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201154621/http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 300&amp;nbsp;horse breeds in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hedge, Juliet  |author2=Don M.

==Interaction with humans==
[[File:Three Counties Equine Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 1770200.jpg|thumb|Equine hospital in the [[United Kingdom]]]]
Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. The genetic makeup of the human population in a geographical area is affected by the presence or absence of horses (more variation in Africa, less in Eurasian steppes). Societies where horse riding is an integral part of life have developed traditional attires specially suited for horse riding such as tightly wrapping [[waistband]]s or [[Cummerbund]]s giving wide support useful for protecting the spine during long journeys, and voluminous headgear such as [[turban]] to protect the skull during falls from the horse. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/573/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=573#ancor|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-05|title=FAO Stat&amp;nbsp;— Live Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Horse Council]] estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Most Comprehensive Horse Study Ever Reveals A Nearly $40 Billion Impact On The U.S. Economy|accessdate=2005-06-20|publisher= American Horse Council |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060625083812/http://www.cthorsecouncil.org/AHC2005JuneEconStudy.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 "poll" conducted by [[Animal Planet]], more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.&lt;ref name=IOL&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iol.co.za/news/back-page/tiger-tops-dog-as-world-s-favourite-animal-1.228797|title=Tiger tops dog as world's favourite animal |accessdate=2011-06-01 |website= Independent Online|publisher= Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;&lt;ref name="Olsen"/&gt; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a [[saddle]] on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a [[bridle]] or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwards, Elwyn Hartley |title=Horses|edition=Second American |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location= New York, NY|year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7894-8982-1 |oclc=50798049|pages= 32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Self, Margaret Cabell|title=Riding Simplified|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iUTm7aD1Mf8C&amp;pg=PA55 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4191-0087-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Thorson, Juli S. |title=Rugged Lark |editor= Martindale, Cathy and Kathy Swan |encyclopedia= Legends 7: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares |publisher=Western Horseman |location= Colorado Springs, CO |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-911647-79-2 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many horses are also [[Driving (horse)|driven]], which requires a [[horse harness|harness]], bridle, and some type of [[horse-drawn vehicle|vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Mettler, John J Jr.|title= Horse Sense: A Complete Guide to Horse Selection and Care|publisher= Storey Communications, Inc.|location= Pownal, VT|year= 1989 |isbn=978-0-88266-549-8 |oclc= 19324181|pages=47–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===
&lt;!-- There is a whole article about Equestrianism for all details about every possible sport. This article should only give the bare summary. So, please do not add elaborate sections of your own favorite horse sport here. --&gt;

{{Main|Equestrianism|Horse racing|Horse training|Horse tack}}
Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as [[dressage]], [[eventing]] and [[show jumping]], have origins in [[horses in warfare|military training]], which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as [[rodeo]], developed from practical skills such as those needed on working [[ranch]]es and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]]. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;{{cite book |author= Olsen, Sandra L.|chapter=In the Winner's Circle: The History of Equestrian Sports|title= Horses Through Time|edition= First|publisher= Roberts Rinehart Publishers|location= Boulder, CO |year= 1996 |isbn=978-1-57098-060-2 |oclc= 36179575|pages=105, 111–113, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse racing]] of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.&lt;ref name="Olsen"/&gt;

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include [[show jumping]], [[dressage]], three-day [[eventing]], [[combined driving|competitive driving]], [[endurance riding]], [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|gymkhana]], [[rodeo]]s, and [[fox hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 346–356, 366–371&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse show]]s, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as [[halter (horse show)|"In-hand"]] classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 376–377&lt;/ref&gt;
Sports such as [[polo]] do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.&lt;ref name=Edwards360&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include [[jousting]], in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Collins, Tony |author2= Martin, John |author3= Vamplew, Wray  |title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NWu6sLJn7-kC&amp;pg=PA174|publisher=Routledge |year=2005|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-415-35224-6|oclc=57005595|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[buzkashi]], a team game played throughout [[Central Asia]], the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.&lt;ref name=Edwards360/&gt;

[[Horse racing]] is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], i.e. racing over jumps; and [[harness racing]], where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a [[sulky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards|Edwards]], pp. 332–337&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the [[Gambling#Parimutuel betting|gambling]] associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, B.N. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-p7ZF9KW8-MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA111,M1 |title=National Gambling Impact Study Commission Final Report (1999)|publisher=DIANE Publishing |location=Darby, PA|year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7567-0701-9|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also be the only form of transport allowed in [[wilderness area]]s. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles.

Modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action [[historical reenactment]]s of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackhorsetroop.org/activities/|title= Unit Activities|accessdate=2008-04-29|author= Stoddard, Samuel |website= Co H, 4th Virginia Cavalry|publisher= Washington Webworks, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Transport/Transport.aspx|title= Transport|accessdate=2009-08-30|publisher= British Monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public exhibitions are another example, such as the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]], seen in parades and other public settings, a team of [[draft horse]]s that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anheuser-Busch gives face time to Budweiser Clydesdales|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|author=McWilliams, Jeremiah|accessdate=2010-09-18|date=December 3, 2008|url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/columns/lager-heads/article_98704685-a144-52b1-aba7-7b580e8f8c08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses are frequently used in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=6630|title=Hollywood Horses|author=Sellnow, Les|date=March 1, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-21|registration=yes|journal=The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both live horses and [[Secular icon|iconic]] images of horses are used in [[advertising]] to promote a variety of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hippomaxx-muenster.de/english/sonderausstellung.php?navid=7|title=Trademark Horse&amp;nbsp;– Horses as advertising mediums|publisher=Westfälische Pferdemuseum (Westphalian Horse Museum)|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in [[heraldry]], in a variety of poses and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fox-Davies, Arthur Charles|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xSeEWjQCTIAC&amp;pg=PA202|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc|year=2007|isbn=978-1-60239-001-0|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mythology|mythologies]] of many cultures, including [[Greco-Roman mythology|Greco-Roman]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Islamic mythology|Islamic]], and [[Norse mythology|Norse]], include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tozer, Basil|title=The horse in history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9-grAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86|publisher=Methuen|year=1908|location=London|oclc=2484673|pages= 94, 98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]] related to the [[Chinese calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.c-c-c.org/chineseculture/zodiac/Horse.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104433/http://www.c-c-c.org/chineseculture/zodiac/Horse.html|archivedate= 2011-07-16|title= Year of the Horse|accessdate=2007-07-22|publisher= Chinese Culture Center of San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapeutic use===
{{See also|Hippotherapy|Therapeutic horseback riding}}
People of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bush, Karen  |author2=Julian Marczak|title= The Principles of Teaching Riding: The Official Manual of the Association of British Riding Schools|publisher= David &amp; Charles|year= 2005|isbn=978-0-7153-1902-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uCQYEduHy8cC&amp;pg=PA58 |oclc= 224946044|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the [[Paralympic Games]] and recognition of [[para-equestrian]] events by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage |title=About Para Equestrian Dressage |accessdate=2010-03-07 |publisher=Federation Equestre Internationale |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135709/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippotherapy]] and [[therapeutic horseback riding]] are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.narha.org/PDFFiles/FAQ_Hippotherapy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Frequently Asked Questions About Hippotherapy|accessdate=2008-07-08 |website= FAQ&amp;nbsp;– AHA, April 2005|publisher= American Hippotherapy Association |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919090815/http://www.narha.org/PDFFiles/FAQ_Hippotherapy.pdf |archivedate = September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. "Equine-assisted" or "equine-facilitated" therapy is a form of experiential [[psychotherapy]] that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.narha.org/SecEFMHA/FactSheet.asp|title=Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-07-08 |publisher= Equine Facilitated Mental Health Association |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430025532/http://www.narha.org/SecEFMHA/FactSheet.asp |archivedate = April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also experimental programs using horses in [[prison]] settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce [[recidivism]] when they leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Wise, Mike |date=2003-08-10|title= Partners, Horse and Man, in Prison Pasture |work= New York Times |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E6D91331F933A2575BC0A9659C8B63 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products===
Horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.

Products collected from living horses include mare's milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the [[Mongols]], who let it ferment to produce [[kumis]].&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/25/050425fa_fact4|title= Invaders: Destroying Baghdad|accessdate=2008-04-03 |author= Frazier, Ian |journal= The New Yorker|date= 2005-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other [[nomad]]ic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling.

[[File:Chicken anatomy.jpg|thumb|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a chicken.]]
In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as ''[[cock (bird)|cock]]s'', whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called ''[[rooster]]s''. Males less than a year old are ''[[cockerels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cockerel |title=Cockerel – definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[castration|Castrated]] roosters are called ''[[capon]]s'' (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as ''hens'', and younger females as ''[[pullet]]s'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pullet |title=Pullet – definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age.  In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term ''[[chook]]'' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʊ|k}} to describe all ages and both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Definition of "chook" in ''Encarta''.  The vernacular use is said to be offensive in this dictionary but it may also be used as a term of jocular familiarity |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQrJia9?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young are often called ''chicks''.

"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJCTL_mC5w4C |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2001-01-01 |isbn=978-0300138139 |first=Janet Vorwald |last=Dohner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species as a whole was then called ''domestic fowl'', or just ''[[fowl]]''.  This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British [[public house]] or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example [[Hen and Chicken Islands]]). The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used.

In the [[Deep South]] of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term ''[[yardbird]]''.&lt;ref name=berhardt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berhardt |first1=Clyde E.

[http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060806/NEWS/608060400/1007/NEWS02 Tuscaloosanews.com "World’s oldest chicken starred in magic shows, was on 'Tonight Show’"], ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' (Alabama, USA).

Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (''hackles'') and backs (''saddle''), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
A ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].
Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

=== Behavior ===
==== Social behaviour ====
[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]
[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]
Chickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "[[pecking order]]", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock " Musings from a Stonehead |publisher=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.

A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |title=Top cock: Roosters crow in pecking order |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1993-07-01 |title=On the meaning of alarm calls: functional reference in an avian vocal system |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347283711589 |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1158 |issn=0003-3472 |last1=Evans |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Evans |first2=Linda |last3=Marler |first3=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Courtship ====
To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.&lt;ref name="grandin69"&gt;{{cite book |title=Animals in Translation |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |author2=Johnson, Catherine |year=2005 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7432-4769-6 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance triggers a response in the hen&lt;ref name="grandin69" /&gt; and when she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.

More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:  1. Male approaching the hen.  2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing.  3. Male waltzing.  4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet  on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cheng |first=Kimberly M.  and Burns, Jeffrey T. |date=1988 |title=Dominance relationship and mating behavior of domestic cocks--a model to study mate-guarding and sperm competition in birds |url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v090n03/p0697-p0704.pdf |journal=The Condor |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=697–704 |via= |doi=10.2307/1368360 |jstor=1368360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nesting and laying behaviour ====
[[File:Chicken eggs.jpg|thumb|200px|Chicken [[egg (biology)|eggs]] vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) ([[Araucana]] varieties).]]
[[File:Küken vor dem ersten Ausflug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chicks before their first outing]]

Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own.  The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2–3 |pages=211–222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Broodiness ====
Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go [[Broodiness|broody]]".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe.  While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation.  To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest.  To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.

[[Breed]]s artificially developed for [[egg as food|egg production]] rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] or [[Goose|geese]].

==== Hatching and early life ====
Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.&lt;ref name="grandin69" /&gt;  Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by "pipping"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.

Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]].  Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://ps.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/5/789.short | doi=10.3382/ps.0640789| pmid=4001066| title=Early Egg Production in Genetically Blind (rc/rc) Chickens in Comparison with Sighted (Rc+/rc) Controls| journal=Poultry Science| volume=64| issue=5| pages=789–794| year=1985| last1=Ali| first1=A.| last2=Cheng| first2=K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.

=== Embryology ===
[[File:Embryo.ogv|thumb|Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo]]
In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds "turned on" a chicken [[recessive gene]], ''talpid2'', and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have "...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1666805 Scientists Find Chickens Retain Ancient Ability to Grow Teeth] Ammu Kannampilly, [[ABC News]], February 27, 2006.

== Breeding ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:Gallus gallus male Kaziranga 0.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Male red junglefowl.]]

The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the [[red junglefowl]] (''Gallus gallus'') and is scientifically classified as the same species.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong |first1=GK |display-authors=etal |title=A genetic variation map for chicken with 2.8 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7018 |pages=717–722 |doi=10.1038/nature03156 |pmid=15592405 |pmc=2263125 |date=December 2004 |bibcode=2004Natur.432..717B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the [[grey junglefowl]] (''G. sonneratii'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eriksson |first1=J |last2=Larson |first2=G |last3=Gunnarsson |first3=U |last4=Bed'hom |first4=B |last5=Tixier-Boichard |first5=M |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Identification of the Yellow Skin Gene Reveals a Hybrid Origin of the Domestic Chicken |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000010 |journal=PLoS Genet |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e1000010 |pmid=18454198 |pmc=2265484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that chickens [[domestication|were first domesticated]] for [[cockfighting]] in Asia, Africa, and Europe.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of [[Thailand]] gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.&lt;ref name="oneMatriarch"&gt;{{citation |title=One subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus gallus) suffices as the matriarchic ancestor of all domestic breeds |first=A |last=Fumihito |first2=T |last2=Miyake |first3=S |last3=Sumi |first4=M |last4=Takada |first5=S |last5=Ohno |first6=N |last6=Kondo |journal=PNAS |date=December 20, 1994 |volume=91 |number=26 |pages=12505–12509 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.26.12505 |pmid=7809067 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9112505F |pmc=45467}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the [[clade]] found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], where a large number of unique [[haplotype]]s occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Yi-Ping |last=Liu |first2=Gui-Sheng |last2=Wu |first3=Yong-Gang |last3=Yao |first4=Yong-Wang |last4=Miao |first5=Gordon |last5=Luikart |first6=Mumtaz |last6=Baig |first7=Albano |last7=Beja-Pereira |first8=Zhao-Li |last8=Ding |first9=Malliya Gounder |last9=Palanichamy |first10=Ya-Ping |last10=Zhang |title=Multiple maternal origins of chickens: Out of the Asian jungles |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |number=1 |year=2006 |pages=12–19 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.09.014 |pmid=16275023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zeder |year=2006 |title=Documenting domestication: the intersection of genetics and archaeology |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.01.007 |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=139–155 |pmid=16458995 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is postulated that the red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year [[bamboo]] seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Rick |last=King |title=Rat Attack |date=February 24, 2009 |journal=NOVA and National Geographic Television |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/rat-attack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Rick |last=King |title=Plant vs. Predator |date=February 1, 2009 |journal=NOVA |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/plant-vs-predator.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1=B. |last2=Zhou |first2=B.X. |year=1988 |title=Did chickens go north?

Instead, the origin could be the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan culture]] of the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]]. Eventually, the chicken moved to the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim basin]] of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="CHOF"&gt;CHOF : The Cambridge History of Food, 2000, [[Cambridge University Press]], vol.1,  pp496-499&lt;/ref&gt;
Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the [[Roman Empire]], and was reduced in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;  [[DNA sequencing|Genetic sequencing]] of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the [[High Middle Ages]] chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Marley |title=Fast Food |journal=Archaeology |date=Sep–Oct 2017 |volume=70 |issue=5 |page=18 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=38&amp;sid=d022d3dd-d76c-4a0c-8bda-3d22c2e5033b%40sessionmgr103 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |format=PDF |issn=0003-8113 |postscript={{subscription needed |via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in [[Syria]]; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached [[Egypt]] for purposes of [[cockfighting]] about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] Egypt (about 300 BC).&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt; Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa. It was during the [[Hellenistic period]] (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"/&gt; This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe.

Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian [[Nile River|Nile]] Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]]. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by [[extinction]] may also help with research into this area.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

==== South America ====
An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the [[araucana]], bred in southern [[Chile]] by the [[Mapuche]] people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and are evidence of [[pre-Columbian]] trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the [[Arauco Peninsula]] in [[Zona Sur|south-central Chile]]. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070604/full/447620b.html DNA reveals how the chicken crossed the sea] Brendan Borrell, ''Nature'', June 5, 2007. Retrieved October 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Storey et al., "Radiocarbon and DNA evidence for a pre-Columbian introduction of Polynesian chickens to Chile", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0703993104; John Noble Wilford, "First Chickens in Americas were Brought from Polynesia, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gongora |first1=Jaime |last2=Rawlence |first2=Nicolas J. |last3=Mobegi |first3=Victor A. |last4=Jianlin |first4=Han |last5=Alcalde |first5=Jose A. |last6=Matus |first6=Jose T. |last7=Hanotte |first7=Olivier |last8=Moran |first8=Chris |last9=Austin |first9=J. | last10 = Ulm | first10 = Sean |last11=Anderson |first11=Atholl J. |last12=Larson |first12=Greger |last13=Cooper |first13=Alan |year=2008 |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA |url= |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=30 |pages=10308–10313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105 |pmid=18663216 |pmc=2492461 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10510308G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of poultry are raised in [[Intensive animal farming|factory farms]]. According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], 74 percent of the world's poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Towards Happier Meals In A Globalized World |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/towards-happier-meals-globalized-world |publisher=World Watch Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to intensive poultry farming is [[free-range]] farming.

Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of [[ethical consumerism]]. Opponents of [[intensive farming]] argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ilea |first=Ramona Cristina |date=2009-04-01 |title=Intensive Livestock Farming: Global Trends, Increased Environmental Concerns, and Ethical Solutions |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=153–167 |doi=10.1007/s10806-008-9136-3 |issn=1187-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tilman |first=David |last2=Cassman |first2=Kenneth G. |last3=Matson |first3=Pamela A. |last4=Naylor |first4=Rosamond |last5=Polasky |first5=Stephen |date=2002-08-08 |title=Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/nature01014.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6898 |pages=671–677 |doi=10.1038/nature01014 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=12167873 |bibcode=2002Natur.418..671T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reared for meat ====
{{Main|Broiler}}
[[File:Florida chicken house.jpg|thumb|right|A commercial chicken house with open sides raising broiler pullets for meat]]
Chickens farmed for meat are called [[broiler]]s. Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalsaustralia.org/factsheets/broiler_chickens.php |title=Broiler Chickens Fact Sheet // Animals Australia |publisher=Animalsaustralia.org |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[free range]] or [[Organic (food)|organic]] broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age.

==== Reared for eggs ====
{{Main|Egg as food}}
Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.egginfo.co.uk/egg-facts-and-figures/industry-information/data |title=UK Egg Industry Data {{!}} Official Egg Info |website=www.egginfo.co.uk |access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hen [[List of chicken breeds|breeds]] can produce over 300 eggs per year, with "the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0440423104/ ''Guinness World Records 2011''] ed. by Craig Glenday – page 286&lt;/ref&gt;  After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable.  Hens, particularly from [[battery cage]] systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years.&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/story/0,,662799,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Ten weeks to live |first=Anthony |last=Browne |date=March 10, 2002 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as "soup hens".&lt;ref name="Browne" /&gt;  In some other countries, flocks are sometimes [[Forced molting|force moulted]], rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying.

=== As pets ===
{{Main|Chickens as pets}}
Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many find their behaviour entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upc-online.org/home.html |title=Providing a Good Home for Chickens |author=United Poultry Concerns |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain breeds, such as [[Silkie]]s and many [[Bantam (poultry)|bantam]] varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henkeeping.co.uk/which.html |title=Clucks and Chooks: A guide to keeping chickens |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730222405/http://www.henkeeping.co.uk/which.html |archivedate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial incubation ===
[[File:Egg incubator.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An egg incubator]]
Incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct, controlled environment for the developing chick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-2104/ANSI-8100web.pdf |author=Joe G.

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8&amp;nbsp;°F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|°C|°F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.

Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.

== Diseases and ailments ==
Chickens are susceptible to several [[parasite]]s, including [[lice]], [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[flea]]s, and [[Roundworm|intestinal worms]], as well as other diseases.  Despite the name, they are not affected by [[chickenpox]], which is generally restricted to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2001.tb00416.x |last1=White |first1=T.

[[File:Persian Cock.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vatican Persian Cock — A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican ([[Holy See]]) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] denoting the status of being [[holy]] in that religious schema.]]
Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Adler |first1=Jerry |last2=Lawler |first2=Andrew |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Chicken-Conquered-the-World.html |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deeply embedded within belief systems and [[religious worship]]. The term "Persian bird" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact "because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peters |first=John P. |date=1913 |title=The Cock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGUPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=33 |pages=363–396 |jstor=592841 |doi=10.2307/592841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]] the chicken has great significance during the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[cremation]] ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.

In [[ancient Greece]], the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were "[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.

The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.

In the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: "Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34&lt;/ref&gt; It happened,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.

Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34. For a recent study of chickens in the New Testament, see Joshua N. Tilton "[http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ Chickens and the Cultural Context of the Gospels]" [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ www.jerusalemperspective.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century, [[Pope Gregory I]] declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by [[Edward Walford]], [[John Charles Cox]], George Latimer Apperson – page 202&lt;/ref&gt; and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by [[Pope Nicholas I]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com" /&gt; ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philadelphia Museum bulletin'', Volumes 1-5, Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, p 14, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Central European [[Folklore|folk tales]], the [[devil]] is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.

In traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called [[kapparos]]; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.

The [[Talmud]] speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's mate" from the rooster.&lt;ref&gt;Eruvin 100b.&lt;/ref&gt; This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks",&lt;ref&gt;A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron – 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b&lt;/ref&gt; which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of "A cock girded about the loins" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay–Rheims Bible]]) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",&lt;ref&gt;PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages&lt;/ref&gt; identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.

The chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with "serious" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today.

A [[cockatrice]] was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's call.

== In history ==

An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (''*manuk'') is part of the reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language]] {{crossref|(see [[Austronesian languages]])}}. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the [[Lapita]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ9ULYwX3zgC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Chickens,+together+with+dogs+and+pigs,+were+the+domestic+animals+of+the+Lapita+culture,+the+first+Neolithic+culture+of+Oceania.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3e3mOr4AZE&amp;sig=MJjoAwUowJLntgnWNZpz2CQxpOc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmVLUPPYD8KO2AWrt4GYAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chickens%2C%20together%20with%20dogs%20and%20pigs%2C%20were%20the%20domestic%20animals%20of%20the%20Lapita%20culture%2C%20the%20first%20Neolithic%20culture%20of%20Oceania.&amp;f=false] The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders By Donald Denoon, Malama Meleisea – Cambridge University Press, March 25, 2004 – page 56&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Neolithic]] culture of Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlSspaBLkhoC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;lpg=PA411&amp;dq=lapita+the+first+Neolithic+culture+of+Oceania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WIEGSQMt8O&amp;sig=vH8TP9pGgf2FwZ4upxIjoxfCXbs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1GVLUIqrIMaI2gW_uYCIBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lapita%20the%20first%20Neolithic%20culture%20of%20Oceania&amp;f=false] Anthropological Genetics: Theory, Methods and Applications edited by Michael H.

In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for [[Symposium|symposia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onagriculturewit02coluuoft |title=On agriculture, with a recension of the text and an English translation by Harrison Boyd Ash |last=Columella |first=Lucius Junius Moderatus |date=1941 |publisher=Cambridge Harvard University Press |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delos]] seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, ''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4).

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] used chickens for oracles, both when flying ("ex avibus", [[Augury]]) and when feeding ("auspicium ex tripudiis", [[Alectryomancy]]). The hen ("gallina") gave a favourable omen ("auspicium ratum"), when appearing from the left (Cic., de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl.

In 162 BC, the ''Lex Faunia'' forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QmevzbQ0AsIC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=Rome+forbade+the+consumption+of+fattened+chickens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oNJ71NY_rm&amp;sig=KgEDxCUwRHAtFHMDRS8t4Uw5jlk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nndLUJaJHc6ByAHYtoC4DQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rome%20forbade%20the%20consumption%20of%20fattened%20chickens&amp;f=false] A History of Food By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat – John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 25, 2009 – page 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[A History of Food By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat – John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 25, 2009 – page 305]&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters ([[capon]]), which resulted in a doubling of size&lt;ref&gt;Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, (Anthea Bell, translator) ''The History of Food'', Ch. 11 "The History of Poultry", revised ed. 2009, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty "tail" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).

The Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.

According to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).

Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and "poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=surOAlOzK9&amp;sig=M7g4WsSKZE0xt-tSoYD8dmPyi8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MqJLULLIMarg2wWtpoHYDQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Per%20Columella%2C%20chicken%20coops&amp;f=false] The New England farmer, Volume 6 By Thomas Greene Fessenden – Thomas W. Shepard, 1828 – page 69&lt;/ref&gt; Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.

According to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.

Chickens were spread by [[Polynesia]]n seafarers and reached [[Easter Island]] in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the [[Polynesian rat]] (''Rattus exulans'').

A '''zebu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|b|(|j|)|uː|,_|ˈ|z|eː|b|uː}}; ''Bos primigenius indicus'' or ''Bos indicus'' or ''Bos taurus indicus''), sometimes known as '''indicine cattle''' or '''humped cattle''', is a species or subspecies of domestic [[cattle]] originating in [[South Asia]]. Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large [[dewlap]], and sometimes drooping ears. They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] countries, both as pure zebu and as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s with [[taurine cattle]], the other main type of domestic cattle. Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s,  [[dairy cattle]], and  [[beef cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as [[Hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]]. Zebu, namely [[Miniature Zebu]], are kept as [[companion animal]]s. In 1999, researchers at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] successfully cloned a zebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/437391.stm |title=Cloning gives second chance for bull |date=1999-09-03 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and name==
The scientific name of zebu cattle was originally ''Bos indicus'', but they are now more commonly classified within the [[species]] ''Bos taurus'' as ''B. t. indicus'', together with taurine cattle (''B. t. taurus'') and the [[Extinction|extinct]] ancestor of both of them, the [[aurochs]] (''B. t. primigenius'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammal Species of the World: Information on taurus|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=14200687|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taurine ("European") cattle are descended from the Eurasian aurochs, while zebu are descended from the [[Indian aurochs]]. "Zebu" may be either singular or plural, but "zebus" is also an acceptable plural form. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name, ''cebu'' or ''cebú'', is also present in a few English works.

==Origin==
[[Image:Rampurva bull capital side.jpg|thumb|upright|An early representation of a zebu, on the [[Rampurva]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], third century BC]]
Zebu cattle are thought to be derived from [[Indian aurochs]], sometimes regarded as a [[subspecies]], ''B. p. namadicus.''&lt;ref name="Vuure"&gt;{{cite book |author=van Vuure, Cis |year=2005 |title=Retracing the Aurochs: History, Morphology and Ecology of an Extinct Wild Ox |publisher=Pensoft Publishers |location=Sofia-Moscow |isbn=954-642-235-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild Asian aurochs disappeared during the time of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] from its range in the [[Indus River]] basin and other parts of the South Asian region possibly due to interbreeding with domestic zebu and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.&lt;ref name="IWH2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rangarajan, Mahesh |year=2001 |title=India's Wildlife History |page=4 |location=[[Delhi]], India |publisher=Permanent Black |isbn=978-81-7824-140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence including pictures on pottery and rocks suggests that the species were present in Egypt around 2000 BC and were thought to be imported from the near east or south. ''Bos indicus'' is believed to have first appeared in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] between 700 and 1500 and was introduced to the [[Horn of Africa]] around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2743556|title = Rethinking the Role of Bos indicus in Sub-Sahara Africa|last = Marshall|first = Fiona|date = April 1989 |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages= |doi = 10.1086/203737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeds and hybrids==
[[File:Hariana_02.JPG|thumbnail|[[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] breed of Zebu cattle in north [[India]]]]
Some 75 breeds of zebu are known, split about evenly between African breeds and Indian ones. The major zebu cattle breeds of the world include [[Gyr cattle|Gyr]], [[Kankrej cattle and Guzerat cattle|Kankrej and Guzerat]], [[Indo-Brazilian cattle|Indo-Brazilian]], [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]],[[Cholistani (cattle)|Cholistani]], [[Nelore]], [[Ongole cattle|Ongole]], [[Sahiwal cattle|Sahiwal]], [[Red Sindhi cattle|Red Sindhi]], [[Butana and Kenana cattle|Butana and Kenana]], [[Boran cattle|Boran]], [[Baggara cattle|Baggara]], Tharparkar, [[Kangayam cattle|Kangayam]], [[Southern Yellow cattle|Southern Yellow]], Kedah-Kelantan, and Local Indian Dairy (LID). Kedah-Kelantan and LID originated from Malaysia. Other breeds of zebu are quite local, like the [[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] of [[Haryana]] and eastern [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hariana — India: Haryana, eastern Punjab" page 245 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Rath of [[Alwar district|Alwar]] in eastern [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rath — India: Alwar and eastern Rajasthan" page 246 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African [[sanga cattle]] breeds originated from hybridization of zebu with indigenous African humpless cattle; they include the [[Afrikaner cattle|Afrikaner]], [[Red Fulani cattle|Red Fulani]], [[Ankole-Watusi]], and many other breeds of central and southern Africa.  Sanga cattle can be distinguished from pure zebu by having smaller humps located farther forward on the animals.
[[File:Zébus de Madagascar 02.jpg|thumb|Zebu market in [[Madagascar]]]]

Zebu were imported to Africa over many hundreds of years, and interbred with [[taurine cattle]] there. Genetic analysis of African cattle has found higher concentrations of zebu genes all along the east coast of Africa, with especially pure cattle on the island of [[Madagascar]], either implying that the method of dispersal was cattle transported by ship or alternatively, the zebu may have reached East Africa via the coastal route (Pakistan, Iran, Southern Arabian coast) much earlier and crossed over to Madagascar. Partial resistance to [[rinderpest]] led to another increase in the frequency of zebu in Africa.

Zebu, which can tolerate extreme heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/cattle-breeds#/1 |title=Food Ark - Cattle Breeds - Pictures, More From National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; were imported into [[Brazil]] in the early 20th century and crossbred with [[Charolais cattle]], a European taurine breed. The resulting breed, 63% Charolais and 37% zebu, is called the [[Canchim]]. It has a better meat quality than the zebu and better heat resistance than European cattle. The zebu breeds used were primarily Indo-Brazilian with some Nelore and Guzerat.

Many breeds are complex mixtures of the zebu and various taurine types, and some also have [[yak]], [[gaur]], or [[banteng]] genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Zebu are very common in much of Asia, including China, India, Nepal, and almost all countries in Southeast Asia. In Asia, taurine cattle are only found in the northern regions such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Mongolia]], possibly domesticated separately from the other taurine cattle originating from Europe and Africa).  Other species of cattle domesticated in parts of Asia include yak, gaur, banteng, and [[water buffalo]].

[[Hanwoo]] is a traditional Korean taurine–zebu hybrid breed.

==Characteristics==
Zebu have humps on the shoulders, large dewlaps, and droopy ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?zebu|publisher=Online Medical Dictionary|accessdate=2007-09-08|title=Definition: Zebu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to taurine cattle, zebus are well adapted to the hot, dry environment of the tropics. Adaptations include resistance to drought and tolerance of intense heat and sunlight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Review of a Reproductive Performance of Female Bos Indicus (zebu) Cattle|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mR7422SxIw4C|publisher = ILRI (aka ILCA and ILRAD)|date = 1989-01-01|isbn = 9789290530992|first = E.|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Zebu are generally mature enough to begin reproducing around 44 months old. This is based on the development of their bodies to withstand the strain of carrying and lactation. Early reproduction can place too much stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. Carrying time of the calf averages at 285 days, but varies depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The sex of the calf may also affect the carrying time, as male calves are carried for a shorter period than females. Location, breed, body weight, and season affect the overall health of the animal and in return may also affect the carrying period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ILCA Monograph No. 6|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa|first = E.|publisher = ILCA|year = 1989|isbn = |location = Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s, [[dairy cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as hides, [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]], and bone for knife handles and the like. Zebu, mostly [[Miniature Zebu|miniature zebu]], are kept as [[pet]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

''B. t. indicus'' cows commonly have low production of milk. They do not produce milk until maturation later in their lives and do not produce much, giving it solely to their calves. When ''B. t. indicus'' is crossed with ''B. t. taurus,'' production generally increases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''sheep–goat hybrid''' (called a '''geep''' in popular media or sometimes a '''shoat''') is the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of a [[sheep]] and a [[goat]]. Although sheep and goats seem similar and can be mated, they belong to different genera in the subfamily [[goat-antelope|Caprinae]] of the family [[Bovid]]ae. Sheep belong to the genus ''[[Ovis]]'' and have 54 [[chromosome]]s, while goats belong to the genus ''[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]'' and have 60 chromosomes.  The offspring of a sheep-goat pairing is generally stillborn. Despite widespread shared pasturing of goats and sheep, hybrids are very rare, indicating the genetic distance between the two species. Though sometimes called "geep",&lt;ref name="geep"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geep: Rare 'goat-sheep' born on Irish farm|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26870598|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are not to be confused with [[sheep–goat chimera]], which are artificially created by combining the embryos of a goat and a sheep.

==Cases==
At the [[Botswana]] Ministry of Agriculture in 2000, a male sheep impregnated a female goat resulting in a live offspring. This hybrid had 57 [[chromosome]]s, intermediate between sheep (54) and goats (60) and was intermediate between the two parent species in type. It had a coarse outer coat, a woolly inner coat, long goat-like legs and a heavy sheep-like body. Although infertile, the hybrid had a very active libido, mounting both ewes and does even when they were not in heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Funny creature' toast of Botswana| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/813466.stm | last = Amos | first = Jonathan | work = BBC News | date = 2000-07-03 | accessdate = 2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was castrated when he was 10 months old, as were the other kids and lambs in the herd.&lt;ref name=SRR_2000&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=10818315&amp;dopt=Abstract |title=Sheep-goat hybrid born under natural conditions. – PubMed – NCBI |website=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2015-09-28 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male sheep impregnated a female goat in [[New Zealand]] resulting in a mixed litter of kids and a female sheep-goat hybrid with 57 chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16031565&amp;dopt=Abstract |title=A case of a sheep-goat hybrid in New Zealand. – PubMed – NCBI |website=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2015-09-28 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid was subsequently shown to be fertile when mated with a ram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2757269&amp;dopt=Abstract |title=Blood genetic marker studies of a sheep-goat hybrid and its back-cross offspring. – PubMed – NCBI |website=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2015-09-28 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]] natural mating of a doe with a ram produced a female hybrid carrying 57 chromosomes. This animal backcrossed in the veterinary college of [[Nantes]] to a ram delivered a stillborn and a living male offspring with 54 chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Characteristics==
There is a long-standing belief in sheep–goat hybrids, which is presumably due to the animals' resemblance to each other. Some primitive varieties of sheep may be misidentified as goats. In ''Darwinism – An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection With Some Of Its Applications'' (1889), [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote: &lt;!-- 1889 text copyright expired (not copyvio) --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the following statement of Mr. Low: "It has been long known to shepherds, though questioned by naturalists, that the progeny of the cross between the sheep and goat is fertile. Breeds of this mixed race are numerous in the north of Europe." Nothing appears to be known of such hybrids either in Scandinavia or in Italy; but Professor Giglioli of Florence has kindly given me some useful references to works in which they are described. The following extract from his letter is very interesting: "I need not tell you that there being such hybrids is now generally accepted as a fact. [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] (''Supplements'', tom. iii. p. 7, 1756) obtained one such hybrid in 1751 and eight in 1752. Sanson (''La Culture'', vol. vi. p. 372, 1865) mentions a case observed in the Vosges, France. Geoff. St. Hilaire (''Hist. Nat. Gén. des reg. org.'', vol. iii. p. 163) was the first to mention, I believe, that in different parts of South America the ram is more usually crossed with the she-goat than the sheep with the he-goat. The well-known 'pellones' of Chile are produced by the second and third generation of such hybrids (Gay, 'Hist, de Chile,' vol. i. p. 466, ''Agriculture'', 1862). Hybrids bred from goat and sheep are called 'chabin' in French, and 'cabruno' in Spanish. In Chile such hybrids are called 'carneros lanudos'; their breeding ''inter se'' appears to be not always successful, and often the original cross has to be recommenced to obtain the proportion of three-eighths of he-goat and five-eighths of sheep, or of three-eighths of ram and five-eighths of she-goat; such being the reputed best hybrids."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supposedly, most sheep–goat hybrids die as [[embryo]]s. Hybrid male [[mammals]] are often sterile, demonstrating a phenomenon known as [[Haldane's rule]]. The Haldane phenomenon may apply even when the parent species have the same number of chromosomes, as in most [[Felidae|cat-species]] hybrids. It sometimes does not apply when the species chromosome number is different, as in [[Equus ferus|wild horse]] (chromosome number = 66) with [[Domestic Horse|domestic horse]] (chromosome number = 64) hybrids. Hybrid female fertility tends to decrease with increasing divergence in chromosome similarity between parent species. Presumably,{{speculation-inline|date+April 2014}} this is due to mismatch problems during [[meiosis]] and the resulting production of [[Egg cell|egg]]s with unbalanced genetic complements.

The '''Fuegian dog''' ({{lang-es|perro yagán, perro fueguino}}), also known as the '''Yaghan dog''', is an extinct domesticated canid. It was a domesticated form of the [[culpeo]], '''''Lycalopex culpaeus''''', unlike other domesticated canids – [[dog]]s, domesticated from the [[gray wolf]] ''Canis lupus'', and the [[domesticated fox]], from the [[red fox]] ''Vulpes vulpes''.

There are very few surviving specimens of Fuegian dog.  These include one in the Museo Salesiano Maggiorino Borgatello in Chile,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} and another in the Fagnano Regional Museum in Tierra del Fuego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fulltext.study/preview/pdf/1041543.pdf R.S. Petrigh, M.H. Fugassa, ''Quaternary International'' '''317''' (2013), pp 14-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Fuegian dogs had erect ears, sharp snout and a thick tail, tawny colored or entirely white.  Surviving images show them to be a similar size to the wild culpeo, which weighs {{convert|5|to|13.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, or roughly the size of a [[Shetland Sheepdog]].   [[Gaucho]]s called Fuegian dogs "maned dogs" because of their resemblance to the [[maned wolf]]. [[Lucas Bridges]] described the Fuegian dog as "a stunted cross between an [[German Shepherd|Alsatian police dog]] and a wolf".&lt;ref&gt;Bridges, L., (2008). Op. Cit. pp.97&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=source title missing|date=March 2018}}

It was described by Captain Martial, who headed the 1883 scientific expedition to Cape Horn, as “ugly, with long tawny hair and a sharp snout, it looks quite like a fox".&lt;ref&gt;Martial, L., (2005). Mision al Cabo de Hornos, la expedición científica francesa en la Romanche Julio de 1882 a setiembre de 1883. Ushuaia: Zaguier &amp; Urruty Publications . pp. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
Although the Fuegian dog's distribution corresponded with that of the [[Yaghan people]], individual animals were not loyal to their human owners. Julius Popper pointed out the canid's lack of loyalty: "I never saw them, no matter how large their number, take an aggressive attitude or defend their masters when these were in danger".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, J., (1887). Expedición Popper. [Conferencia]. Instituto Geográfico Militar. 05.03.1887. Museo del Fin del Mundo, Biblioteca Virtual&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Fuegian dogs were not used to hunt [[guanaco]]. However, they might have been useful for hunting [[otter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martial, L., (2005). Mision al Cabo de Hornos, la expedición científica francesa en la Romanche Julio de 1882 a setiembre de 1883. Ushuaia: Zaguier &amp; Urruty Publications . pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs were also useful to humans in that they would gather around their owners to keep them warm. This was noted by [[Julius Popper]]: "The dogs placed themselves in a group around the small [[Selk'nam|Onas]], taking the shape of a kind of wrapping […] my opinion is that the Fuegian dogs are only useful to complete the defective garment of the Indian, or better, as the Ona’s heating furniture".

==Extermination==
In 1919, when Salesian missionary [[Martin Gusinde]] visited the Yaghans, he noticed their dogs were gone. The Fuegian dogs were exterminated because they "were dangerous to men and cattle”. Their fierce nature was also noted by [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]] in the 1880s, who wrote that they attacked his Mission’s goats.&lt;ref&gt;Orquera, L. and Piana, E. (1999). La vida material y social de los Yámana. B. Aires: EUDEBA. pp 178-180&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ferret''' (''Mustela putorius furo'') is the [[Domestication|domesticated]] form of the [[European polecat]], a mammal belonging to the same [[genus]] as the [[weasel]], ''[[Mustela]]'' of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mustelidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris &amp; Yalden 2008, pp. 485–487&lt;/ref&gt; They typically have brown, black, white, or mixed fur. They have an average length of {{convert|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} including a {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} tail, weigh about {{nowrap|{{convert|1.5|–|4|lb|sigfig=1}}}}, and have a natural lifespan of 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060721081758/http://www.bradleyhills.com/ferrets/surgery/health/ Bradley Hills Animal Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, on lifespan of Ferrets]. Bradleyhills.com. Retrieved 2012-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrets are sexually [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] predators with males being substantially larger than females.

Several other Mustelids also have the word ''ferret'' in their common names, including an [[endangered species]], the [[black-footed ferret]].

The history of the ferret's domestication is uncertain, like that of most other domestic animals, but it is likely that ferrets have been domesticated for at least 2,500&amp;nbsp;years. They are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of the world, but increasingly they are kept only as pets.

Being so closely related to polecats, ferrets easily hybridize with them, and this has occasionally resulted in feral colonies of [[polecat-ferret hybrid]]s that have caused damage to native fauna, especially in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/ferrets/|title = Ferrets: New Zealand animal pests|date = 11 August 2006|accessdate = 25 July 2014|website = Department of Conservation|publisher = New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC)|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724222620/http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/ferrets/|archivedate = 2014-07-24|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some parts of the world have imposed restrictions on the keeping of ferrets.

==Etymology==
The name "ferret" is derived from the Latin ''furittus'', meaning "little thief", a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ferret ferret]. Merriam-webster.com. Retrieved 2012-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''ictis'' occurs in a play written by [[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Acharnians]]'', in 425 BC. Whether this was a reference to ferrets, polecats, or the similar [[Egyptian mongoose]] is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt;

==Biology==

===Characteristics===
[[File:Mustela putorius furo profile.JPG|thumb|Ferret profile]]
Ferrets have a typical Mustelid body-shape, being long and slender. Their average length is about 50&amp;nbsp;cm including a 13-cm tail. Their [[pelage]] has various colorations including brown, black, white or mixed. They weigh between 0.7&amp;nbsp;kg and 2.0&amp;nbsp;kg and are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] as the males are substantially larger than females. The average [[gestation]] period is 42 days and females may have two or three litters each year. The [[Litter (animal)|litter]] size is usually between three and seven kits which are weaned after three to six weeks and become independent at three months. They become sexually mature at approximately six months and the average life span is seven to 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://njvma.org/all-about-ferrets/ |publisher=New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association |title=All about ferrets |access-date=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmwoodparkzoo.org/animal-domestic-ferret.php |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |title=Domestic ferret |publisher=Elmwood Park Zoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
&lt;!-- do not add information on keeping ferrets as it will be deleted, wikipedia is not a "how to" manual&amp;nbsp;– see talk page--&gt;
Ferrets spend 14–18 hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk, meaning they are [[crepuscular]].&lt;ref name="Anon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pethealthinfo.org.uk/ferrets/|title=Ferrets|publisher=Pet Health Information|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their polecat ancestors, which are solitary animals, most ferrets will live happily in social groups. A group of ferrets is commonly referred to as a "business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=John G.|title=Robertson's Words for a Modern Age: A Cross Reference of Latin and Greek Combining Elements|year=1991|publisher=Senior Scribe Publications|isbn=978-0-9630919-1-8|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5hlO8sgpCgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are territorial, like to burrow, and prefer to sleep in an enclosed area.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art036.php|title=Inherited behavior traits of the domesticated ferret|last=Brown|first=Susan, A|publisher=weaselwords.com|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[skunks]], ferrets can release their [[anal gland]] secretions when startled or scared, but the smell is much less potent and dissipates rapidly. Most pet ferrets in the US are sold de-scented (anal glands removed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Mark A.|last2=Tully|first2=Thomas N.|title=Manual of exotic pet practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTUKwzPEvwC&amp;pg=PA372|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4160-0119-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many other parts of the world, including the UK and other European countries, de-scenting is considered an [[Overview of discretionary invasive procedures on animals|unnecessary mutilation]].

Ferrets are [[obligate carnivore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Bruce H.

Ferrets imprint on their food at around six months old. This can make introducing new foods to an older ferret a challenge, and even simply changing brands of kibble may meet with resistance from a ferret that has never eaten the food as a kit. It is therefore advisable to expose young ferrets to as many different types and flavors of appropriate food as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.ferret.org/read/faq.html|work=American Ferret Association|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dentition===
[[Image:buffy teeth.jpg|thumb|Ferret dentition]]
Ferrets have four types of teeth (the number includes maxillary (upper) and mandibular (lower) teeth) with a [[dental formula]] of 3/3 1/1 4/4 1/2:
*Twelve small teeth (only a couple of millimeters) located between the canines in the front of the mouth. These are known as the [[incisor]]s and are used for grooming.
*Four [[Canine tooth|canines]] used for killing prey.
*Twelve [[premolar]] teeth that the ferret uses to chew food—located at the sides of the mouth, directly behind the canines. The ferret uses these teeth to cut through flesh, using them in a scissors action to cut the meat into digestible chunks.
*Six molars (two on top and four on the bottom) at the far back of the mouth are used to crush food.

===Health===
{{Main|Ferret health}}
[[Image:Jake 0314.jpg|thumb|Male ferret]]
Ferrets are known to suffer from several distinct health problems. Among the most common are cancers affecting the [[adrenal glands]], [[pancreas]], and [[Lymphoma in ferrets|lymphatic system]]. Viral diseases include [[canine distemper]] and influenza. Health problems can occur in unspayed females when not being used for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://weaselwords.com/ferret-articles/an-owners-guide-to-ferret-health-care/ |title= An Owners Guide to Ferret Health Care|last1= Van Dahm |first1= Mary |website=WeaselWords.com|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain health problems have also been linked to ferrets being neutered before reaching sexual maturity.{{Citation needed|reason=This is anecdotally popular in the ferret community but needs a source to verify veracity|date=April 2014}} Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as [[Waardenburg syndrome]]. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems.

==History of domestication==
[[File:Women hunting rabbits with a ferret.jpg|right|thumb|''Women hunting rabbits with a ferret'' in the [[Queen Mary Psalter]]]]
In common with most domestic animals, the original reason for ferrets being domesticated by human beings is uncertain, but it may have involved hunting. According to phylogenetic studies, the ferret was domesticated from the [[European polecat]] (''Mustela putorius''), and likely descends from a North African lineage of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sato|first=JJ|author2=Hosoda, T; Wolsan, M; Tsuchiya, K; Yamamoto, M; Suzuki, H|title=Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among mustelids (Mammalia: Carnivora) based on nucleotide sequences of the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein and mitochondrial cytochrome b genes|journal=Zoological Science|date=February 2003|volume=20|issue=2|pages=243–64|pmid=12655187|doi=10.2108/zsj.20.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] suggests that ferrets were domesticated around 2,500 years ago. It has been claimed that the ancient Egyptians were the first to domesticate ferrets, but as no mummified remains of a ferret have yet been found, nor any [[hieroglyph]] of a ferret, and no polecat now occurs wild in the area, that idea seems unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Colonies of [[feral]] ferrets have established themselves in areas where there is no competition from similarly sized predators, such as in the [[Shetland Islands]] and in remote regions in New Zealand. Where ferrets coexist with polecats, hybridization is common. It has been claimed that New Zealand has the world's largest feral population of ferret-polecat hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feral Ferrets in New Zealand |work=California's Plants and Animals |publisher=California Department of Fish and Game |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/species/nuis_exo/ferret/ferret_issues_3.shtml |accessdate=2006-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905185101/http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/species/nuis_exo/ferret/ferret_issues_3.shtml |archivedate=2006-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, farmers in New Zealand demanded that ferrets be introduced into the country to control the rabbit population, which was also introduced by humans. Five ferrets were imported in 1879, and in 1882–1883, 32 shipments of ferrets were made from London, totaling 1,217 animals. Only 678 landed, and 198 were sent from Melbourne, Australia. On the voyage, the ferrets were mated with the European polecat, creating a number of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] that were capable of surviving in the wild. In 1884 and 1886, close to 4,000 ferrets and ferret hybrids, 3,099 weasels and 137 [[stoat]]s were turned loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbit control |work=A Hundred Years of Rabbit Impacts, and Future Control Options |publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) Rabbit Biocontrol Advisory Group |url=http://www.maf.govt.nz/MAFnet/articles-man/rbag/rbag0010.htm |accessdate=2006-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010617215222/http://www.maf.govt.nz/MAFnet/articles-man/rbag/rbag0010.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern was raised that these animals would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once rabbit populations dropped, and this is exactly what happened to New Zealand's bird species which previously had had no mammalian predators.

===Ferreting===
{{Main|Rabbiting}}
[[File:Ratting ferret 2.png|thumb|right|Muzzled ferret flushing a rat, as illustrated in Harding's ''Ferret Facts and Fancies'' (1915)]]
For millennia, the main use of ferrets was for hunting, or ''ferreting''. With their long, lean build, and inquisitive nature, ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows. [[Caesar Augustus]] sent ferrets or mongooses (named ''viverrae'' by [[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]]) to the [[Balearic Islands]] to control the rabbit plagues in 6 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plinius the Elder, Natural History, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/8*.html#218 8 lxxxi 218] (in Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], Book VIII |last=Pliny the Elder |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |others=[[Philemon Holland]] (trans) |year=1601 |chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny8.html |accessdate=19 April 2011 |chapter=LV. Of Hares and Connies. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, in 1390, a law was enacted restricting the use of ferrets for hunting to the relatively wealthy:
{{quote|it is ordained that no manner of layman which hath not lands to the value of forty shillings a year shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or other dog to hunt, nor shall he use ferrets, nets, heys, harepipes nor cords, nor other engines for to take or destroy deer, hares, nor conies, nor other gentlemen's game, under pain of twelve months' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Mackay1891"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mackay, Thomas, ed. |title=Plea for Liberty |year=1891 |publisher=D. Appleton and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ferrets were first introduced into the New World in the 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West from rodents. They are still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom, where rabbits are considered a [[Rabbit (ecology)|plague species]] by farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Mystery, Ferret Thefts Sweep Southern England|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290013495981126|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321170935/https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304361604579290013495981126|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is illegal in several countries where it is feared that ferrets could unbalance the ecology. In 2009 in Finland, where ferreting was previously unknown, the city of Helsinki began to use ferrets to restrict the city's rabbit population to a manageable level. Ferreting was chosen because in populated areas it is considered to be safer and less ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbits.

==As pets==
[[Image:Vinnie the Ferret in a War Dance Jump.jpg|thumb|right|A ferret in a [[Weasel war dance|war dance]] jump.]]

In the United States, ferrets were relatively rare pets until the 1980s. A government study by the California State Bird and Mammal Conservation Program estimated that by 1996 about 800,000 domestic ferrets were being kept as pets in the United States.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Jurek, R. M. (1998). [http://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentVersionID=39971 A review of national and California population estimates of pet ferrets]. Calif. Dep. Fish and Game, Wildl. Manage. Div., Bird and Mammal Conservation Program Rep. 98-09. Sacramento, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many household pets, ferrets require a cage. For ferrets, a wire cage at least 18 inches long and deep and 30 inches wide or longer is needed. Ferrets cannot be housed in environments such as an aquarium because of the poor ventilation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/ferrets/tips/ferret_housing.html?credit=web_id139808899 |title=Ferret Housing: The Humane Society of the United States |website=www.humanesociety.org |access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is preferable that the cage have more than one level but this is not crucial. Usually two to three different shelves are used.

===Regulation===
*'''Australia''': It is illegal to keep ferrets as pets in '''Queensland''' or the '''Northern Territory'''; in the '''[[Australian Capital Territory]]''' a licence is required.
*'''Brazil''': They are allowed only if they are given a [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchip identification tag]] and sterilized.
*'''New Zealand''': It has been illegal to sell, distribute or breed ferrets in New Zealand since 2002 unless certain conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1953/0031/latest/DLM278701.html#DLM278701 Wildlife Act 1953]&amp;nbsp;– Schedule 8&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''United States''': Ferrets were once banned in many US states, but most of these laws were rescinded in the 1980s and 1990s as they became popular pets.

Most ferrets are either albinos, with white fur and pink eyes, or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestors. In recent years fancy breeders have produced a wide variety of colors and patterns. Color refers to the color of the ferret's guard hairs, undercoat, eyes, and nose; pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body, mask, and nose, as well as white markings on the head or feet when present. Some national organizations, such as the American Ferret Association, have attempted to classify these variations in their showing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferret.org/events/colors/colorchart.html |title=American Ferret Association: Ferret Color and Pattern Standards |publisher=Ferret.org |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four basic colors. The sable (including chocolate and dark brown), albino, dark eyed white (DEW), and the silver. All the other colors of a ferret are variations on one of these four categories.

===Waardenburg-like coloring===
[[Image:Coco 4056.JPG|right|thumb|White or albino ferret]]Ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head, primarily blazes, badgers, and pandas, almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to [[Waardenburg syndrome]]. This causes, among other things, a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull, white face markings, and also partial or total deafness. It is estimated as many as 75&amp;nbsp;percent of ferrets with these Waardenburg-like colorings are deaf.

White ferrets were favored in the Middle Ages for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth. Leonardo da Vinci's painting ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' is likely mislabelled; the animal is probably a ferret, not a stoat, (for which "ermine" is an alternative name for the animal in its white winter coat). Similarly, the ermine portrait of Queen Elizabeth the First shows her with her pet ferret, which has been decorated with painted-on [[Heraldry|heraldic]] ermine spots.

"The Ferreter's Tapestry" is a 15th-century tapestry from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy, France]], now part of the Burrell Collection housed in the Glasgow Museum and Art Galleries. It shows a group of peasants hunting rabbits with nets and white ferrets. This image was reproduced in ''Renaissance Dress in Italy 1400–1500'', by Jacqueline Herald, Bell &amp; Hyman.{{efn|{{ISBN|0-391-02362-4}}}}

''Gaston Phoebus' Book of the Hunt'' was written in approximately 1389 to explain how to hunt different kinds of animals, including how to use ferrets to hunt rabbits. Illustrations show how multicolored ferrets that were fitted with muzzles were used to chase rabbits out of their warrens and into waiting nets.

==Import restrictions==
* '''Australia'''&amp;nbsp;– Ferrets cannot be imported into Australia. A report drafted in August 2000 seems to be the only effort made to date to change the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''Canada'''&amp;nbsp;– Ferrets brought from anywhere except the US require a Permit to Import from the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] Animal Health Office. Ferrets from the US require only a vaccination certificate signed by a veterinarian. Ferrets under three months old are not subject to any import restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* '''European Union'''&amp;nbsp;– {{as of|2004|July}}, dogs, cats, and ferrets can travel freely within the European Union under the [[pet passport]] scheme. To cross a border within the EU, ferrets require at minimum an EU PETS passport and an identification microchip (though some countries will accept a tattoo instead). Vaccinations are required; most countries require a rabies vaccine, and some require a [[Canine distemper|distemper]] vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas 24 to 48 hours before entry. Ferrets occasionally need to be quarantined before entering the country. PETS travel information is available from any EU veterinarian or on government websites.
* '''United Kingdom'''&amp;nbsp;– The UK accepts ferrets under the EU's PETS travel scheme. Ferrets must be microchipped, vaccinated against [[rabies]], and documented. They must be treated for ticks and tapeworms 24 to 48 hours before entry. They must also arrive via an authorized route. Ferrets arriving from outside the EU may be subject to a six-month quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Taurine cattle''' (''Bos taurus taurus''), also called '''European cattle''', are a subspecies of domesticated [[cattle]] originating in the [[Near East]].

Genetic research suggests the entire modern stock of taurine cattle may have arisen from as few as 80 aurochs tamed in the upper reaches of [[Mesopotamia]] about 10,500 years ago near the villages of [[Çayönü]] in southeastern Turkey and [[Dja'de el Mughara]] in northern [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="HowNowCow"&gt;Bollongino, Ruth, at al.

The '''domestication of animals''' is the mutual relationship between [[animals]] and the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction.&lt;ref name=zeder2015/&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] recognized the small number of traits that made [[domestication|domesticated]] species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.&lt;ref name=darwin1868/&gt;&lt;ref name=diamond2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014b/&gt; There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.&lt;ref name=olsen2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=doust2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or [[Landrace|regional populations]].&lt;ref name=doust2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer2013/&gt;

Domestication should not be confused with [[tame animal|taming]]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans.&lt;ref name=price2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=macdonald2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=diamond2012/&gt; Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;{{rp|Fig 1}}&lt;ref name=hale1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=price1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=price2002/&gt;

It is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., [[Domestication of the dog|dogs]], cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama, alpaca, and turkey); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., [[Domestication of the horse|horse]], donkey, camel).&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=blaustein2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=telechea2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=vahabi2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=pontarotti2015/&gt; The dog was the first to be domesticated,&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=perri2016/&gt; and was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and before the domestication of other animals.&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt; Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.&lt;ref name=serpell2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt; The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional [[gene flow]] between wild and domestic stocks – including [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, New and Old World [[camelid]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s – was common.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall2014/&gt; One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=frantz2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=pennisi2015/&gt;

==Definitions==

===Domestication===

Domestication has been defined as "a sustained multi-generational, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship in which one [[organism]] assumes a significant degree of influence over the [[reproduction]] and care of another organism in order to secure a more predictable supply of a resource of interest, and through which the [[Symbiosis|partner organism]] gains advantage over individuals that remain outside this relationship, thereby benefitting and often increasing the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of both the domesticator and the target domesticate."&lt;ref name=zeder2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=maggioni2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=sykes2014/&gt; This definition recognizes both the biological and the cultural components of the domestication process and the effects on both humans and the domesticated animals and plants. All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;

This [[Mutualism (biology)|biological mutualism]] is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the [[ant–fungus mutualism]] that exists between [[leafcutter ants]] and certain fungii.&lt;ref name=zeder2015/&gt;

===Domestication syndrome===

Domestication syndrome is a term often used to describe the suite of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors.&lt;ref name=olsen2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=hammer1984/&gt; The term is also applied to animals and includes  increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.&lt;ref name=wilkins2014/&gt;

===Difference from taming===

Domestication should not be confused with [[tame animal|taming]]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans.&lt;ref name=price2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=macdonald2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=diamond2012/&gt; Human selection included tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated.&lt;ref name=macdonald2009/&gt; Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is not human controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.&lt;ref name=macdonald2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=lair1997/&gt;

The domestication of animals began with the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') at least 15,000 [[years before present]] (YBP), which then led to a rapid shift in the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], and [[demography]] of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; The sudden appearance of the [[domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') in the archaeological record was followed by livestock and crop domestication, as well as the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=fuller2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2006/&gt;

Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication,&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=bocquet2011/&gt; the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=barker2006/&gt;

==Universal features==
The biomass of wild vertebrates is now increasingly small compared to the biomass of domestic animals, with the calculated biomass of domestic cattle alone being greater than that of all wild mammals.&lt;ref name=smil2011/&gt; Because the evolution of domestic animals is ongoing, the process of domestication has a beginning but not an end. Various criteria have been established to provide a definition of domestic animals, but all decisions about exactly when an animal can be labelled "domesticated" in the zoological sense are arbitrary, although potentially useful.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;
Domestication is a fluid and nonlinear process that may start, stop, reverse, or go down unexpected paths with no clear or universal threshold that separates the wild from the domestic. However, there are universal features held in common by all domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;

===Behavioral preadaption===
Certain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics: (1) the size and organization of their social structure; (2) the availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates; (3) the ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth; (4) the degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and (5) responses to humans and new environments, including flight responses and reactivity to external stimuli.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;{{rp|Fig 1}}&lt;ref name=hale1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=price1984/&gt;&lt;ref name=price2002/&gt; Reduced wariness to humans and low reactivity to both humans and other external stimuli are a key pre-adaptation for domestication, and these behaviors are also the primary target of the selective pressures experienced by the animal undergoing domestication.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; This implies that not all animals can be domesticated, e.g. a wild member of the horse family, the [[Zebra#Domestication|Zebra]].&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2006/&gt;

One researcher has enquired as to why, among the world's 148 large wild terrestrial herbivorous mammals, only 14 were domesticated, and proposed that their wild ancestors must have possessed six characteristics before they could be considered for domestication:&lt;ref name=diamond2007/&gt;{{rp|p168-174}}

#Efficient diet&amp;nbsp;– Animals that can efficiently process what they eat and live off plants are less expensive to keep in captivity. Carnivores feed on flesh, which would require the domesticators to raise additional animals to feed the carnivores and therefore increase the consumption of plants further.
#Quick growth rate&amp;nbsp;– Fast maturity rate compared to the human life span allows breeding intervention and makes the animal useful within an acceptable duration of caretaking. Some large animals require many years before they reach a useful size.
#Ability to breed in captivity&amp;nbsp;– Animals that will not breed in captivity are limited to acquisition through capture in the wild.
#Pleasant disposition&amp;nbsp;– Animals with nasty dispositions are dangerous to keep around humans.
#Tendency not to panic&amp;nbsp;– Some species are nervous, fast, and prone to flight when they perceive a threat.
#Social structure&amp;nbsp;– All species of domesticated large mammals had wild ancestors that lived in herds with a dominance hierarchy amongst the herd members, and the herds had overlapping home territories rather than mutually exclusive home territories. This arrangement allows humans to take control of the dominance hierarchy.

===Brain size and function===
[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|right|Reduction in skull size with neoteny - grey wolf and chihuahua skulls]]

The sustained selection for lowered reactivity among mammal domesticates has resulted in profound changes in brain form and function. The larger the size of the brain to begin with and the greater its degree of folding, the greater the degree of brain-size reduction under domestication.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=kruska1988/&gt; [[domesticated red fox|Foxes that had been selectively bred for tameness over 40 years]] had experienced a significant reduction in cranial height and width and by inference in brain size,&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=trut1999/&gt; which supports the hypothesis that brain-size reduction is an early response to the selective pressure for tameness and lowered reactivity that is the universal feature of animal domestication.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; The most affected portion of the brain in domestic mammals is the limbic system, which in domestic dogs, pigs, and sheep show a 40% reduction in size compared with their wild species. This portion of the brain regulates endocrine function that influences behaviors such as aggression, wariness, and responses to environmentally induced stress, all attributes which are dramatically affected by domestication.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=kruska1988/&gt;

===Pleiotropy===
A putative cause for the broad changes seen in domestication syndrome is [[pleiotropy]]. Pleiotropy occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated [[phenotypic trait]]s. Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of many species. These changes include extensive white markings (particularly on the head), floppy ears, and curly tails. These arise even when tameness is the trait under selective pressure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Trut |first=Lyudmila |last2=Oskina |first2=Irina |last3=Kharlamova |first3=Anastasiya |date=2009 |title=Animal evolution during domestication: the domesticated fox as a model |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200800070/abstract |journal=BioEssays |volume=31|issue=3 |pages=349–360 |doi=10.1002/bies.200800070 |pmc=2763232 |pmid=19260016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, so it is not known how or to what extent pleiotropy contributes to domestication syndrome. Tameness may be caused by the [[Downregulation and upregulation|down regulation]] of fear and stress responses via reduction of the [[adrenal gland]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on this, the pleiotropy hypotheses can be separated into two theories. The Neural Crest Hypothesis relates adrenal gland function to deficits in neural crest cells during development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network Hypothesis claims that genetic changes in [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] regulators affect downstream systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=Adam S. |last2=Wrangham |first2=Richard W. |last3=Fitch |first3=W. Tecumseh |date=2014 |title=The "Domestication Syndrome" in Mammals: A Unified Explanation Based on Neural Crest Cell Behavior and Genetics |url= http://www.genetics.org/content/197/3/795|journal=Genetics |language=en|volume=197 |issue=3 |pages=795–808 |doi=10.1534/genetics.114.165423 |pmc=4096361|pmid=25024034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright |date=2015 |title=The Genetic Architecture of Domestication in Animals |url= http://www.la-press.com/the-genetic-architecture-of-domestication-in-animals-article-a5123 |journal=Bioinformatics and Biology Insights |doi=10.4137/bbi.s28902 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neural crest|Neural crest cells]] (NCC) are vertebrate [[embryonic stem cell]]s that function directly and indirectly during early [[embryogenesis]] to produce many tissue types.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because the traits commonly affected by domestication syndrome are all derived from NCC in development, the neural crest hypothesis suggests that deficits in these cells cause the domain of phenotypes seen in domestication syndrome.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These deficits could cause changes we see to many domestic mammals, such as lopped ears (seen in rabbit, dog, fox, pig, sheep, goat, cattle, and donkeys) as well as curly tails (pigs, foxes, and dogs). Although they do not affect the development of the adrenal cortex directly, the neural crest cells may be involved in relevant upstream embryological interactions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, artificial selection targeting tameness may affect genes that control the concentration or movement of NCCs in the embryo, leading to a variety of phenotypes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The single genetic regulatory network hypothesis proposes that domestication syndrome results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression pattern of more downstream genes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example piebald, or spotted coat coloration, may be caused by a linkage in the biochemical pathways of melanins involved in coat coloration and neurotransmitters such as dopamine that help shape behavior and cognition.&lt;ref name="zeder2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hemmer1990" /&gt; These linked traits may arise from mutations in a few key regulatory genes.&lt;ref name="zeder2012" /&gt; A problem with this hypothesis is that it proposes that there are mutations in gene networks that cause dramatic effects that are not lethal, however no currently known genetic regulatory networks cause such dramatic change in so many different traits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Limited reversion===
Feral mammals such as dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, pigs, and ferrets that have lived apart from humans for generations show no sign of regaining the brain mass of their wild progenitors.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=birks1999/&gt; [[Dingo]]s have lived apart from humans for thousands of years but still have the same brain size as that of a domestic dog.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=schultz1969/&gt; Feral dogs that actively avoid human contact are still dependent on the human niche for survival and have not reverted to the self-sustaining behaviors of their wolf ancestors.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=boitani1995/&gt;

==Categories==
Domestication can be considered as the final phase of intensification in the relationship between animal or plant sub-populations and human societies, but it is divided into several grades of intensification.&lt;ref name=vigne2011/&gt; For studies in animal domestication, researchers have proposed five distinct categories: wild, captive wild, domestic, cross-breeds and feral.&lt;ref name=price2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;

; ''Wild'' animals : Subject to natural selection, although the action of past demographic events and artificial selection induced by game management or habitat destruction cannot be excluded.&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;
; ''Captive wild'' animals : Directly affected by a relaxation of natural selection associated with feeding, breeding and protection/confinement by humans, and an intensification of artificial selection through passive selection for animals that are more suited to captivity.&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;
;''Domestic'' animals : Subject to intensified artificial selection through husbandry practices with relaxation of natural selection associated with captivity and management.&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;
;''Cross-breed'' animals : Genetic hybrids of wild and domestic parents. They may be forms intermediate between both parents, forms more similar to one parent than the other, or unique forms distinct from both parents. Hybrids can be intentionally bred for specific characteristics or can arise unintentionally as the result of contact with wild individuals.&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;
;''Feral'' animals : Domesticates that have returned to a wild state. As such, they experience relaxed artificial selection induced by the captive environment paired with intensified natural selection induced by the wild habitat.&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;

In 2015, a study compared the diversity of dental size, shape and allometry across the proposed domestication categories of modern pigs (genus ''Sus''). The study showed clear differences between the dental phenotypes of wild, captive wild, domestic, and hybrid pig populations, which supported the proposed categories through physical evidence. The study did not cover feral pig populations but called for further research to be undertaken on them, and on the genetic differences with hybrid pigs.&lt;ref name=evin2015/&gt;

==Pathways==
Since 2012, a multi-stage model of animal domestication has been accepted by two groups. The first group proposed that animal domestication proceeded along a continuum of stages from anthropophily, commensalism, control in the wild, control of captive animals, extensive breeding, intensive breeding, and finally to pets in a slow, gradually intensifying relationship between humans and animals.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=vigne2011/&gt;

The second group proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=blaustein2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=telechea2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=vahabi2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=gepts2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=pontarotti2015/&gt; The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted [[coevolution]]ary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;

===Commensal pathway===
The [[Commensalism|commensal]] pathway was traveled by vertebrates that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human  camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans in which the animals benefited but the humans received no harm but little benefit. Those animals that were most capable of taking advantage of the resources associated with human camps would have been the tamer, less aggressive individuals with shorter fight or flight distances.&lt;ref name=crockford2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=coppinger2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=russell2012/&gt; Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans that led to a domestic relationship.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt; The leap from a [[Synanthrope|synanthropic]] population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, when the relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a [[coevolution]]ary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel [[Ecological niche|niche]] that included another species with evolving behaviors.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

Commensal pathway animals include dogs, cats, fowl, and possibly pigs. The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. The dog was the first domesticant&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=perri2016/&gt; and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the [[Pleistocene]], well before cultivation or the domestication of other animals.&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt;  [[Ancient DNA]] supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture&lt;ref name=vila1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt; and was initiated close to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] 27,000 YBP when hunter-gatherers preyed on [[megafauna]], and when proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kill-sites.&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt; The wolves most likely drawn to human camps were the less aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, and less wariness around humans, and therefore they were better candidates for domestication.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the [[neoteny|neotenization]] of skull morphology&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=trut1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=morey1992/&gt; and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth,&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=turnbull1974/&gt; which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression.&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=trut1999/&gt; This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;

A maternal [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial]], paternal [[Y chromosome]], and [[Microsatellite#Analysis of microsatellites|microsatellite]] assessment of two wolf populations in North America and combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou, and another territorial [[ecotype]] population that remained in a [[Taiga|boreal]] coniferous forest. Though these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=musiani2007/&gt; A study has identified the remains of a population of extinct [[Pleistocene]] [[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]] with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these were specialist [[megafauna]] hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=leonard2007/&gt; Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=wolpert2013/&gt;

The chicken is one of the most widespread domesticated species and one of the human world's largest sources of protein. Although the chicken was domesticated in South-East Asia, archaeological evidence suggests that it was not kept as a livestock species until 400 [[BCE]] in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=perrygal2015/&gt; Prior to this, chickens had been associated with humans for thousands of years and kept for cock-fighting, rituals, and royal zoos, so they were not originally a prey species.&lt;ref name=perrygal2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=sykes2012/&gt; The chicken was not a popular food in Europe until only one thousand years ago.&lt;ref name=gibbons2016/&gt;

===Prey pathway===
[[File:Animal husbandry.jpeg|thumbnail|Domesticated dairy cows in North India]]
The prey pathway was the way in which most major livestock species entered into domestication as these were once hunted by humans for their meat. Domestication was likely initiated when humans began to experiment with hunting strategies designed to increase the availability of these prey, perhaps as a response to localized pressure on the supply of the animal. Over time and with the more responsive species, these game-management strategies developed into herd-management strategies that included the sustained multi-generational control over the animals’ movement, feeding, and reproduction. As human interference in the life-cycles of prey animals intensified, the evolutionary pressures for a lack of aggression would have led to an acquisition of the same domestication syndrome traits found in the commensal domesticates.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt;

Prey pathway animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right conditions for the domestication for some of them appear to have been in place in the central and eastern [[Fertile Crescent]] at the end of the [[Younger Dryas]] climatic downturn and the beginning of the Early [[Holocene]] about 11,700 YBP, and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to produce more offspring.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt; By measuring the size, sex ratios, and mortality profiles of [[Zooarchaeology|zooarchaeological]] specimens, archeologists have been able to document changes in the management strategies of hunted sheep, goats, pigs, and cows in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains at Sha’ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the intensive exploitation led to management strategies adopted throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt;

===Directed pathway===
[[File:Kazakh shepard with dogs and horse.jpg|thumb|Kazakh shepherd with horse and dogs. Their job is to guard the sheep from predators.]]

The directed pathway was a more deliberate and directed process initiated by humans with the goal of domesticating a free-living animal. It probably only came into being once people were familiar with either commensal or prey-pathway domesticated animals. These animals were likely not to possess many of the [[Domestication#Behavioral preadaptions|behavioral preadaptions]] some species show before domestication. Therefore, the domestication of these animals requires more deliberate effort by humans to work around behaviors that do not assist domestication, with increased technological assistance needed.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt;

Humans were already reliant on domestic plants and animals when they imagined the domestic versions of wild animals. Although horses, donkeys, and Old World camels were sometimes hunted as prey species, they were each deliberately brought into the human niche for sources of transport. Domestication was still a multi-generational adaptation to human selection pressures, including tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; For example, despite the fact that hunters of the Near Eastern [[gazelle]] in the [[Epipaleolithic]] avoided culling reproductive females to promote population balance, neither gazelles&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2006/&gt; nor zebras&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=diamond2002/&gt; possessed the necessary prerequisites and were never domesticated. There is no clear evidence for the domestication of any herded prey animal originating in Africa.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

===Multiple pathways===
The pathways that animals may have followed are not mutually exclusive. Pigs, for example, may have been domesticated as their populations became accustomed to the human niche, which would suggest a commensal pathway, or they may have been hunted and followed a prey pathway, or both.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=zeder2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2015b/&gt;

==Post-domestication gene flow==
As agricultural societies migrated away from the domestication centers taking their domestic partners with them, they encountered populations of wild animals of the same or sister species. Because domestics often shared a recent common ancestor with the wild populations, they were capable of producing fertile offspring. Domestic populations were small relative to the surrounding wild populations, and repeated [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]]s between the two eventually led to the domestic population becoming more genetically divergent from its original domestic source population.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=currat2008/&gt;

Advances in [[DNA sequencing]] technology allow the nuclear [[genome]] to be accessed and analyzed in a [[population genetics]] framework. The increased resolution of [[DNA sequencing|nuclear sequences]] has demonstrated that gene flow is common, not only between geographically diverse domestic populations of the same species but also between domestic populations and wild species that never gave rise to a domestic population.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; The yellow leg trait possessed by numerous modern commercial chicken breeds was acquired via [[introgression]] from the [[grey junglefowl]] indigenous to South Asia.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=eriksson2008/&gt; African cattle are hybrids that possess both a European [[Taurine cattle]] maternal mitochondrial signal and an Asian [[Indicine cattle]] paternal Y-chromosome signature.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=hanotte2002/&gt; Numerous other bovid species, including bison, yak, banteng, and gaur also hybridize with ease.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=verkaar2004/&gt; Cats&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=pierpaoli2003/&gt; and horses&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=jordana1995/&gt; have been shown to hybridize with many closely related species, and domestic honey bees have mated with so many different species they now possess genomes more variable than their original wild progenitors.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=harpur2012/&gt; The archaeological and genetic data suggests that long-term bidirectional gene flow between wild and domestic stocks - including donkeys, horses, New and Old World camelids, goats, sheep, and pigs - was common.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshall2014/&gt; Bidirectional gene flow between domestic and wild reindeer continues today.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

The consequence of this [[introgression]] is that modern domestic populations can often appear to have much greater genomic affinity to wild populations that were never involved in the original domestication process. Therefore, it is proposed that the term "domestication" should be reserved solely for the initial process of domestication of a discrete population in time and space. Subsequent admixture between introduced domestic populations and local wild populations that were never domesticated should be referred to as "introgressive capture". Conflating these two processes muddles our understanding of the original process and can lead to an artificial inflation of the number of times domestication took place.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;

The sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000 years has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs.&lt;ref name=larson2012/&gt; None of the modern wolf populations are related to the [[Pleistocene]] wolves that were first domesticated,&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt; and the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

==Positive selection==
[[Charles Darwin]] recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.&lt;ref name=darwin1868/&gt;&lt;ref name=diamond2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014b/&gt; Domestic animals have variations in coat color as well as texture, dwarf and giant varieties, and changes in their reproductive cycle, and many others have tooth crowding and floppy ears.

Although it is easy to assume that each of these traits was uniquely selected for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=trut1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=trut2009/&gt; In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=hemmer2005/&gt; Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink&lt;ref name=malmkvist2002/&gt; and Japanese quail.&lt;ref name=jones1997/&gt; In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;

[[File:Խոզարած.JPG|thumb|Pig herding in fog, Armenia. Human selection for domestic traits is not affected by later gene flow from wild boar.&lt;ref name=frantz2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=pennisi2015/&gt;]]

The genetic difference between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.&lt;ref name=olsen2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=doust2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt; Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.&lt;ref name=doust2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=meyer2013/&gt; A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from [[positive selection]] resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;

Geneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=cieslak2011/&gt; Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed some correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=ludwig2009/&gt; Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=fang2009/&gt; Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.&lt;ref name=larson2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=hemmer1990/&gt;

In 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. The process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on [[reproductive isolation]] between wild and domestic forms, but the study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with [[population bottleneck]]s was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct [[ghost population]] of wild pigs during the [[Pleistocene]]. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=frantz2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=pennisi2015/&gt;

Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.&lt;ref name="serpell2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt; In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the [[Catecholamine#Synthesis|catecholamine synthesis]] pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Almada RC, Coimbra NC.

}}The '''society finch''' (North America) or '''Bengalese finch''' (elsewhere), ''Lonchura striata domestica'' or ''L. domestica'', is a popular cage bird not found in the wild.

==Evolution==
It is a member of the [[Estrildidae|estrildid finch family]]. Many authorities call it a domestic form of the [[white-rumped munia]] (known in [[aviculture]] as the striated finch),&lt;ref name=K&amp;R&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Koepff | first1 = Christa | last2 = Romagnano | first2 = April | year = 2001 | title = The Finch Handbook | publisher = Barron's Educational Series | pages = 126–127 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T4p0RHRuUa0C&amp;pg=PA126 | accessdate = 2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Price | first = Trevor | year = 2008 | title = Speciation in Birds | publisher = Roberts and Co. | page = 164 | isbn = 0-9747077-8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least probably,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warren | first = Dean M. | year = 2002 | title = Small Animal Care and Management | publisher = Cengage Learning | page = 325 | isbn = 0-7668-1424-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz-3V6_TatUC&amp;pg=PA325 | accessdate = 2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some state that it originated as a hybrid of this species with others in the genus ''Lonchura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Alderton | first = David | year = 1998 | title = The Complete Guide to Bird Care | publisher = Howell Book House | page = 24 | isbn = 0-87605-038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogers | first1 = Cyril | last2 = Clear | first2 = Val | year = 1975 | title = Encyclopedia of Cage and Aviary Birds | publisher = Macmillan | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA study found that it was more closely related to the white-rumped munia but not belonged to Indian muniya family than either bird is to the [[finch]], the [[chestnut-breasted munia]], or the "Silver Bill" (presumably the [[silverbill]]), indicating that it originated from the white-rumped.{{what?|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref name=Okanoya&gt;{{cite book | last = Okanoya | first = Kazuo | year = 2004 | title = Advances in the Study of Behavior, Volume 34 | editor = Slater, Peter.

==Behavior==
Bengalese finches are well adapted to captivity and the company of humans. They breed well&lt;ref name=K&amp;R/&gt; and are good foster parents for other finch-like birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roots | first = Clive | year = 2007 | title = Domestication | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | page = 91 | isbn = 0-313-33987-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WGDYHvOHwmwC&amp;pg=PA91 | accessdate = 2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While two males may not get along without other company, it has been found the best "pairing" for fostering is to use two males, this works better than either two females or a male and female pairing. Two males will usually accept eggs, or even partly grown young without any hesitation.

These birds like to be close together and tend to all roost in one nest if kept in a group. In an [[aviary]] they lay eggs and crowd into a single nest, interfering with incubation (which is performed by the female and lasts 16 days) or damaging the eggs. Thus they breed better if kept as single pairs in individual breeding boxes.&lt;ref name=K&amp;R/&gt; This sociability is also responsible for their American name of "society finch".

Bengalese finches are quite easy to look after. They are also quite easy to breed provided they are properly sexed. Obtaining a female-male pair can present a difficulty because both sexes look similar. However, it is possible to determine gender by behavior since males tend to display to females. One method to sex Bengalese is to place a single bird in a small cage completely isolated it from its own kind (both sight and hearing) and after several hours then introduce another Bengalese to the cage. If the first bird is a male it will immediately display to the newcomer. Unfortunately this does not necessarily mean the introduced bird is a female. But if the first bird does not display it is almost certainly a hen. Also, Society Finches can be housed with other finches including, other societies, Zebra Finches, Gouldian Finches, and Spice Finches.

==Diet==
They are generally given a diet of seeds, such as [[millet]]s and [[canary seed]], and greens.&lt;ref name=K&amp;R/&gt; They will not usually take live-foods, but it has been found they will often accept [[housefly]] pupae, which they crack like seeds. This is particularly useful if they are being used to foster species that require a high protein component to be successfully reared.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==In research==
Society finches have been used extensively in research on [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McFarland | first = David | year = 1999 | title = Animal Behaviour: Psychobiology, Ethology, and Evolution | publisher = Longman | page = 369 | isbn = 0-582-32732-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[bird vocalization]]s, often comparing the structure of their songs to [[syntax]].&lt;ref name=Okanoya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hilliard | first1 = Austin T. | last2 = White | first2 = Stephanie | editor = Bickerton, Derek |editor2=Szathmáry, Eörs | year = 2009 | title = Biological Foundations and Origin of Syntax | chapter = Possible Precursors of Syntactic Components in Other Species | publisher = MIT Press | pages = 161–183 | isbn = 0-262-01356-8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t5SSUvCDhjkC&amp;pg=PA163 | accessdate = 2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abe | first1 = Kentaro | last2 = Watanabe | first2 = Dai | title = Songbirds Possess the Spontaneous Ability to Discriminate Syntactic Rules | journal = Nature Neuroscience | date = 2011-06-26 | url = http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.2869.html | doi = 10.1038/nn.2869| accessdate = 2011-07-14 | volume=14 | pages=1067–1074 | pmid=21706017}}.

'''Beefalo''', also referred to as '''cattalo''' or the '''American hybrid''', are a [[fertility|fertile]] [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring of domestic [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), usually a male in managed breeding programs, and the [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), usually a female in managed breeding programs.&lt;ref name="Porter2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=Valerie|title=The Field Guide to Cattle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6CSqgpIC0YC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=14 May 2015|year=2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3192-7|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew et al 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drew|first1=K.

Beefalo are primarily cattle in genetics and appearance, with the breed association defining a full Beefalo as one with three-eighths (37.5%) bison genetics, while animals with higher percentages of bison genetics are called "bison hybrids".

== History ==
Accidental crosses were noticed as long ago as 1749 in the southern English colonies of North America. Beef and bison were first intentionally [[Crossbreed|crossbred]] during the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dafoe|first1=John W.|title=Domestication of the Buffalo|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=April 1889|volume=34|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_34/April_1889/Domestication_of_the_Buffalo|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first deliberate attempts to cross breed bison with cattle was made by Colonel Samuel Bedson, warden of [[Stony Mountain Institution|Stoney Mountain Penitentiary]], [[Winnipeg]], in 1880. Bedson bought eight bison from a captive herd of James McKay and inter-bred them with [[shorthorn|Durham cattle]]. The hybrids raised by Bedson were described by naturalist [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]:&lt;ref name="Brower2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brower|first=Jennifer|title=Lost Tracks: National Buffalo Park, 1909-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGA2K51m_YQC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=14 May 2015|year=2008|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=978-1-897425-10-7|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''The hybrid animal is [claimed] to be a great improvement on both of its progenitors, as it is more docile and a better milker than the Buffalo, but retains its hardihood, while the robe is finer, darker and more even, and the general shape of the animal is improved by the reduction of the hump and increased proportion of the hind-quarters.''}}

After seeing thousands of cattle die in a Kansas blizzard in 1886, [[Charles "Buffalo" Jones]], a co-founder of [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], [[Kansas]], also worked to cross bison and cattle at a ranch near the future [[Grand Canyon National Park]], with the hope the animals could survive the harsh winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/portraits/jones_charles.htm |title=Charles Jesse "Buffalo" Jones |publisher=Kshs.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the result "cattalo" in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf05/indepth/ |title=The Story of Cattalo |publisher=canadiangeographic.ca |date=May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901164141/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf05/indepth/ |archivedate=2005-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mossom Martin Boyd]] of [[Bobcaygeon]], [[Ontario]] first started the practice in Canada, publishing about some of his outcomes in the Journal of Heredity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M.

For example, in 1936 the Canadian government had successfully cross-bred only 30 cattalos.&lt;ref name="Magazines1934"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magazines|first=Hearst|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yt8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA863|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=December 1934|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=863|chapter=Cattle Developed for North are Part Buffalo|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawrence Boyd continues the crossbreeding work of his grandfather on a farm in [[Alberta]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

It was found early on that crossing a male bison with a domestic cow would produce few offspring, but that crossing a domestic bull with a bison cow apparently solved the problem. The female offspring proved fertile, but rarely so for the males. Although the cattalo performed well, the mating problems meant the breeder had to maintain a herd of wild and difficult-to-handle bison cows.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1965, Jim Burnett of Montana produced a hybrid bull that was fertile.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bovid Hybrid|last=|first=|publisher=Books LLC|year=2010|isbn=9781158607723|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Cory Skowronek of California formed the World Beefalo Association and began marketing the hybrids as a new breed. The new name, Beefalo, was meant to separate this hybrid from the problems associated with the old cattalo hybrids.  The breed was eventually set at being genetically at least five-eighths ''Bos taurus'' and at most three-eighths ''Bison bison''.

== Nutrition characteristics==
{{Advert|section|date=February 2017}}
A [[United States Department of Agriculture]] study{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} found Beefalo meat, like bison meat, to be lower in [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]] than standard beef cattle. The American Beefalo Association states that Beefalo are better able to tolerate cold and need less assistance calving than cattle, while retaining domestic cattle's docile nature and fast growth rate. They damage rangeland less than cattle.&lt;ref name =aba/&gt; They also state that Beefalo meat contains 4 to 6% more protein and is more tender, flavorful, and nutritious than a standard steer.&lt;ref name =aba/&gt; Beefalo has significantly less calories, fat, and cholesterol, than beef cattle, chicken, and cod.&lt;ref name =meats&gt;[http://www.beefalomeats.com/Nutrition.html Nutrition and Taste]&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Beefalo Association states that the "crossbreeds are hardier, are more economical (and less care-intensive) to nurture, and produce meat that's superior to that of the common cow."&lt;ref name =aba&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/beefalo-facts-zmaz81mazraw.aspx Beefalo Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Registration ==
In 1983, the three main Beefalo registration groups reorganized under the American Beefalo World Registry. Until November 2008, there were two Beefalo associations, the American Beefalo World Registry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abwr.org |title=ABWR |publisher=ABWR |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012195541/http://www.abwr.org/| archivedate= 12 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American Beefalo International.

== Cattalo ==
The term "cattalo" is defined by United States law as a cross of bison and cattle which have a bison appearance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200409 |title=Code of Federal Regulations (9CFR352.1) rev 2004.&amp;nbsp;— "Catalo or Cattalo means any hybrid animal with American bison appearance resulting from direct crossbreeding of American bison and cattle." |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826093000/http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200409 |archivedate=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Canada]], however, the term is used for hybrids of all degrees and appearance.

In some U.S. states, cattalo are regulated as "exotic animals", along with pure bison and [[deer]]. However, in most states, bison and hybrids which are raised solely for livestock (meat and sale) purposes similar to cattle, are considered domestic animals like cattle, and do not require special permits.

{{refimprove|date=October 2014}}
A '''breed''' is a specific group of domestic animals having [[homogeneous]] appearance ([[phenotype]]), homogeneous [[behavior]], and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same [[species]]. Breeds are formed through [[genetic isolation]] and either natural [[adaptation]] to the environment or [[selective breeding]], or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of "breeds" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.&lt;ref&gt;The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a [[term of art]] amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.&lt;ref&gt;''The Genetics of Populations''. Jay L Lush. Iowa State University Press. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

When bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this ability{{snd}}known as "[[breeding true]]"{{snd}}is a requirement for a breed. [[Plant]] breeds are more commonly known as [[cultivar]]s. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as [[crossbreed]]s or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|botanical ''variety'']], even different [[Genus|genera]]) are referred to as ''[[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Banga, Surinder S. (November 25, 1998).  ''Hybrid Cultivar Development'', p. 119.  Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|3-540-63523-8}} &lt;!--This is cited only for the fact that plant crosses above the cultivar level are called hybrids; doesn't address animals.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breeder selection===
The [[breeder]] (or group of breeders) who initially establishes a breed does so by [[Selective breeding|selecting]] individual animals from within a [[gene pool]] that they see as having the necessary qualities needed to enhance the breed model they are aiming for. These animals are referred to as [[foundation stock]]. Furthermore, the breeder mates the most desirable representatives of the breed from his or her point of view, aiming  to pass such characteristics to their [[Offspring|progeny]]. This process is known as [[selective breeding]]. A written description of desirable and undesirable breed representatives is referred to as a [[breed standard]].

===Breed characteristics===
Breed specific characteristics, also known as breed traits, are inherited, and [[purebred]] animals pass such traits from [[generation]] to generation. Thus, all specimens of the same breed carry several genetic characteristics of the original foundation animal(s). In order to maintain the breed, a breeder would select those animals with the most desirable traits to achieve further maintenance and developing of such traits. At the same time, the breed would avoid animals carrying characteristics undesirable or not typical for the breed, including faults or [[genetics|genetic]] defects. The [[population]] within the same breed should consist of a sufficient number of animals to maintain the breed within the specified parameters without the necessity of forced [[inbreeding]]. 

Domestic animal breeds commonly differ from country to country, and from nation to nation. Breeds originating in a certain country are known as "native breeds" of that country.

Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is the harvesting of [[wild fish]].&lt;ref name="AmericanHeritageDef"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/aquaculture%7ctitle=aquaculture%7cwork=Answers.com|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mariculture]] refers to aquaculture practiced in marine environments and in underwater habitats.

According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]], aquaculture "is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-aquaculture-production/en Global Aquaculture Production] Fishery Statistical Collections, FAO, Rome.

Particular kinds of aquaculture include [[fish farming]], [[shrimp farm]]ing, [[oyster farming]], [[mariculture]], [[algaculture]] (such as [[seaweed farming]]), and the cultivation of [[ornamental fish]].

===Aquatic plants===
[[File:Yangzhuanghe - CIMG3404.JPG|thumb|Cultivating emergent aquatic plants in floating containers|alt=Aquatic plants in floating containers]]
{{See also|Algaculture|Seaweed farming}}

[[Microalgae]], also referred to as [[phytoplankton]], [[microphytes]], or [[planktonic algae]], constitute the majority of cultivated [[algae]]. Macroalgae commonly known as [[seaweed]] also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild.

===Fish===
{{Main|Fish farming}}
The farming of fish is the most common form of aquaculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, [[fish pond]]s, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]]. Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are, in order, [[carp]], [[salmon]], [[tilapia]], and [[catfish]].&lt;ref name="faostat" /&gt;

In the Mediterranean, young [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore. They are then interned in [[Offshore aquaculture|offshore]] pens where they are further grown for the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0301:DWSTBF]2.0.CO;2 | author = Volpe, J. | year = 2005 | title = Dollars without sense: The bait for big-money tuna ranching around the world | url = | journal = [[BioScience]] | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 301–302 | issn = 0006-3568 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, researchers in Australia managed for the first time to coax [[southern bluefin tuna]] to breed in landlocked tanks. Southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow-out sea cages in southern [[Spencer Gulf]], [[South Australia]].

A similar process is used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Farming the Sea|first=Frank|last=Asche|journal=Marine Resource Economics|volume=23|issue=4|year=2008|pages=527–547 |jstor=42629678|doi=10.1086/mre.23.4.42629678}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Future Seascapes, Fishing, and Fish Farming|first=Rebecca |last=Goldburg |first2=Rosamond |last2=Naylor|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|date=February 2005|pages=21–28|doi=10.2307/3868441|jstor=3868441}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional method, known sometimes as sea ranching, has also been used within the industry. Sea ranching involves raising fish in a [[hatchery]] for a brief time and then releasing them into marine waters for further development, whereupon the fish are recaptured when they have matured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=E.

===Crustaceans===
{{See also|Shrimp farming|Freshwater prawn farming}}
Commercial [[shrimp]] farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply thereafter. Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about [[United States dollar|US$]]9 billion. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.

Shrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[nongovernmental organization]]s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices through the [[Seafood Watch]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Seafood Watch|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium|access-date=2013-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511232001/http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|archive-date=2013-05-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freshwater prawn farm]]ing shares many characteristics with, including many problems with, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental lifecycle of the main species, the [[giant river prawn]].&lt;ref name="freshwater"&gt;New, M.

The global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding [[crayfish]] and [[crab]]s) in 2003 was about 280,000 [[tonne]]s, of which China produced 180,000 tonnes followed by India and Thailand with 35,000 tonnes each. Additionally, China produced about 370,000 tonnes of [[Chinese river crab]].&lt;ref name="figis_fresh"&gt;Data extracted from the [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?dom=collection&amp;xml=global-aquaculture-production.xml FAO Fisheries Global Aquaculture Production Database] for freshwater crustaceans.

Aquacultured shellfish include various [[oyster]], [[mussel]], and clam species. These bivalves are filter and/or deposit feeders, which rely on ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed. As such, shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, J.M. and S.E. Shumway. 2011. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture and eutrophication. In, Shellfish Aquaculture and the Environment. Ed. S.E. Shumway. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the species and local conditions, bivalve molluscs are either grown on the beach, on longlines, or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging. In May 2017 a Belgian consortium installed the first of two trial mussel farms on a wind farm in the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref name="offshorewind.biz2017-06-02belgians"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a  commercial "sea ranch" was set up in [[Flinders Bay]], Western Australia, to raise abalone. The ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of 5000 ({{as of|2016|April}}) separate concrete units called ''abitats'' (abalone habitats). The 900&amp;nbsp;kg abitats can host 400 abalone each. The reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery. The abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the abitats, with the ecosystem enrichment of the bay also resulting in growing numbers of dhufish, pink snapper, wrasse, and Samson fish, among other species.

Brad Adams, from the company, has emphasised the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore-based aquaculture. "We're not aquaculture, we're ranching, because once they're in the water they look after themselves."&lt;ref name="abc.net.au-2014-08-15"&gt;{{cite web

In 2012, the total world production of fisheries was 158 million [[tonne]]s, of which aquaculture contributed 66.6 million tonnes, about 42%.&lt;ref name="SOFIA 2014"&gt;

Aquaculture is an especially important economic activity in China. Between 1980 and 1997, the Chinese Bureau of Fisheries reports, aquaculture harvests grew at an annual rate of 16.7%, jumping from 1.9 million tonnes to nearly 23 million tonnes. In 2005, China accounted for 70% of world production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/fish.html|title=Wired 12.05: The Bluewater Revolution|work=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A31159-2005Jan23 | work=The Washington Post | title=Fish Farming's Bounty Isn't Without Barbs | first=Juliet | last=Eilperin | date=2005-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaculture is also currently one of the fastest-growing areas of food production in the U.S.&lt;ref name="providence1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040820172559/http://www.providence.edu/polisci/students/aquaculture/EnvironmentalImpact.html Environmental Impact of Aquaculture]&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90% of all U.S. shrimp consumption is farmed and imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5600e/y5600e00.HTM|title=The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, salmon aquaculture has become a major export in southern Chile, especially in [[Puerto Montt]], Chile's fastest-growing city.

A [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations]] report titled ''The State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture'' released in May 2014 maintained fisheries and aquaculture support the livelihoods of some 60 million people in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="Aquaculture2014"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fisheries and aquaculture have good future|url=http://www.heraldglobe.com/index.php/sid/222314317/scat/9d7afd9766a94f28/ht/Fisheries-and-aquaculture-have-good-future|accessdate=27 May 2014|publisher=''Herald Globe''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National laws, regulations, and management ===
Laws governing aquaculture practices vary greatly by country&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FAO Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture - FI fact sheet search|url = http://www.fao.org/fishery/nalo/search/en|website = www.fao.org|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often not closely regulated or easily traceable. In the United States, land-based and nearshore aquaculture is regulated at the [[National Aquaculture Act of 1980|federal]] and state levels;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aquaculture - U.S. Aquaculture Legislation Timeline|url = http://www.oceaneconomics.org/LMR/Aquaculture/fedPolicy.aspx|website = www.oceaneconomics.org|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, no national laws govern [[offshore aquaculture]] in U.S. [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eez.html exclusive economic zone] waters. In June 2011, the Department of Commerce and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] released national aquaculture policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Commerce and NOAA release national aquaculture policies to increase domestic seafood production, create sustainable jobs, and restore marine habitats|url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110609_aquaculture.html|website = www.noaanews.noaa.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address this issue and "to meet the growing demand for healthy seafood, to create jobs in coastal communities, and restore vital ecosystems." In 2011, Congresswoman [[Lois Capps]] introduced the ''National Sustainable Offshore Aquaculture Act of 2011''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bill Summary &amp; Status  -  112th Congress (2011 - 2012)  - H.R.2373 - THOMAS (Library of Congress)|url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:10:./temp/~bd9BB5::%257C/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=112%257C|website = thomas.loc.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to establish a regulatory system and research program for sustainable offshore aquaculture in the United States exclusive economic zone"; however, the bill was not enacted into law.

==Over-reporting==
China overwhelmingly dominates the world in reported aquaculture output,&lt;ref name=ChinaStats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/13_22_output_of_aquatic_products.html |title=Output of Aquatic Products |work=China Statistics |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reporting a total output which is double that of the rest of the world put together. However, there are some historical issues with the accuracy of China's returns.

In 2001, the fisheries scientists Reg Watson and [[Daniel Pauly]] expressed concerns in a letter to ''Nature'', that China was over reporting its catch from wild fisheries in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=overreporting&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Watson, Reg |author2=Pauly, Daniel |year=2001 |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Water/Fish-Catch-Distortions.htm |title=Systematic distortions in world Fisheries catch trends |journal=Nature |volume=414 |issue=6863 |pages=534–6 |doi=10.1038/35107050 |pmid=11734851 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531152626/http://www.mindfully.org/Water/Fish-Catch-Distortions.htm |archivedate=2010-05-31 |bibcode=2001Natur.414..534W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearson | first1 = Helen | year = 2001 | title = China caught out as model shows net fall in fish | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6863/full/414477b.html | journal = Nature | volume = 414 | issue = 6863| page = 477 | doi = 10.1038/35107216 | pmid=11734811| bibcode = 2001Natur.414..477P }}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that made it appear that the global catch since 1988 was increasing annually by 300,000 tonnes, whereas it was really shrinking annually by 350,000 tonnes. Watson and Pauly suggested this may be have been related to Chinese policies where state entities that monitored the economy were also tasked with increasing output. Also, until more recently, the promotion of Chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas.&lt;ref&gt;Heilprin, John (2001) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/CaliforniaFish_29Nov01.pdf Chinese Misreporting Masks Dramatic Decline In Ocean Fish Catches] ''Associated Press'', 29 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reville, William (2002) [http://google.com/search?q=cache:9mtEFlgr7BkJ:www.seaaroundus.org/newspapers/2002/IrishTimes_14Mar02.pdf+one-third+china+fish+world+fao&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=9&amp;gl=nz Something fishy about the figures] ''The Irish Times'', 14 Mar 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

China disputed this claim. The official [[Xinhua News Agency]] quoted Yang Jian, director general of the Agriculture Ministry's Bureau of Fisheries, as saying that China's figures were "basically correct".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/WorldCatch_17Dec01.pdf China disputes claim it over reports fish catch] ''Associate Press'', 17 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[FAO]] accepted there were issues with the reliability of China's statistical returns, and for a period treated data from China, including the aquaculture data, apart from the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]] (2006) [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0699e/a0699e.pdf The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOPHIA)] {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130518071948/ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0699e/a0699e.pdf |date=2013-05-18 }}, Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/FIELD/006/Y3354M/Y3354M00.HTM|title=FAO Fisheries Department - FISHERY STATISTICS: RELIABILITY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mariculture}}

[[Mariculture]] refers to the cultivation of marine organisms in [[seawater]], usually in sheltered coastal or offshore waters. The farming of marine fish is an example of mariculture, and so also is the farming of marine crustaceans (such as [[shrimp]]), molluscs (such as [[oyster]]s), and seaweed. Atlantic salmon and mollusk farms is for example prominent in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iatp.org/files/Marine_Aquaculture_in_the_United_States_Enviro.htm|title=Marine Aquaculture in the United States: Environmental Impacts and Policy Options|website=www.iatp.org|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mariculture may consist of raising the organisms on or in artificial enclosures such as in floating netted enclosures for salmon and on racks for oysters. In the case of enclosed salmon, they are fed by the operators; oysters on racks filter feed on naturally available food. Abalone have been farmed on an artificial reef consuming seaweed which grows naturally on the reef units.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au-2016-04-23" /&gt;

===Integrated===
{{Main|Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}}
[[Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]] (IMTA) is a practice in which the byproducts (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, [[food]]) for another. Fed aquaculture (for example, [[fish]], [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive and organic extractive (for example, [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).&lt;ref name="Chopin et al. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chopin | first1 = T | last2 = Buschmann | first2 = AH | last3 = Halling | first3 = C | last4 = Troell | first4 = M | last5 = Kautsky | first5 = N | last6 = Neori | first6 = A | last7 = Kraemer | first7 = GP | last8 = Zertuche-Gonzalez | first8 = JA | last9 = Yarish | first9 = C | last10 = Neefus | first10 = C | year = 2001 | title = Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability | url = | journal = Journal of Phycology | volume = 37 | issue = 6| pages = 975–986 | doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2001.01137.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Multi-trophic" refers to the incorporation of species from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] levels in the same system.&lt;ref name="Chopin 2006"&gt;Chopin T. 2006. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. What it is, and why you should care&amp;nbsp;... and don't confuse it with polyculture. Northern Aquaculture, Vol. 12, No. 4, July/August 2006, pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one potential distinction from the age-old practice of aquatic [[polyculture]], which could simply be the co-culture of different fish species from the same trophic level. In this case, these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes, with few [[synergy|synergistic]] benefits, which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the [[ecosystem]]. Some traditional polyculture systems may, in fact, incorporate a greater diversity of species, occupying several [[Ecological niche|niches]], as extensive cultures (low intensity, low management) within the same  2006"/&gt; A working IMTA system can result in greater total production based on mutual benefits to the co-cultured species and improved [[ecosystem health]], even if the production of individual species is lower than in a monoculture over a short term period.&lt;ref name="Neori et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neori | first1 = A | last2 = Chopin | first2 = T | last3 = Troell | first3 = M | last4 = Buschmann | first4 = AH | last5 = Kraemer | first5 = GP | last6 = Halling | first6 = C | last7 = Shpigel | first7 = M | last8 = Yarish | first8 = C | year = 2004 | title = Integrated aquaculture: rationale, evolution and state of the art emphasizing seaweed biofiltration in modern mariculture | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 231 | issue = | pages = 361–391 | doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.11.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term "integrated aquaculture" is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer.&lt;ref name="Neori et al. 2004"/&gt; For all intents and purposes, however, the terms "IMTA" and "integrated aquaculture" differ only in their degree of descriptiveness. [[Aquaponics]], fractionated aquaculture, integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems, integrated peri-urban-aquaculture systems, and integrated fisheries-aquaculture systems are other variations of the IMTA concept.

==Netting materials==
Various materials, including [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], plastic-coated welded [[wire]], [[rubber]], patented [[rope]] products (Spectra, Thorn-D, Dyneema), [[galvanized steel]] and [[copper]] are used for netting in aquaculture fish enclosures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Offshore Aquaculture in the United States: Economic considerations, implications, and opportunities, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration, July 2008, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Braithwaite&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15596168|year=2005|last1=Braithwaite|first1=RA|last2=McEvoy|first2=LA|title=Marine biofouling on fish farms and its remediation|volume=47|pages=215–52|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(04)47003-5|journal=Advances in marine biology|series=Advances in Marine Biology|isbn=9780120261482}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingnets.com/fishfarm.html |title=Commercial and research fish farming and aquaculture netting and supplies |publisher=Sterlingnets.com |accessdate=2010-06-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726100545/http://www.sterlingnets.com/fishfarm.html| archivedate= 26 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrialnetting.com/aquaculture.htm |title=Aquaculture Netting by Industrial Netting |publisher=Industrialnetting.com |accessdate=2010-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529033431/http://www.industrialnetting.com/aquaculture.htm |archivedate=29 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Regional Aquaculture Center at {{cite web |url=http://aquanic.org/publicat/usda_rac/efs/srac/162fs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119190913/http://aquanic.org/publicat/usda_rac/efs/srac/162fs.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these materials are selected for a variety of reasons, including design feasibility, [[material strength]], cost, and [[corrosion resistance]].

{{Main|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}
Recently, copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture because they are antimicrobial (i.e., they destroy [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], [[algae]], and other [[microbes]]) and they therefore prevent [[biofouling]] (i.e.,  the undesirable accumulation, adhesion, and growth of microorganisms, plants, algae, tubeworms, barnacles, mollusks, and other organisms). By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture cages avoid costly net changes that are necessary with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive.

==Issues==
{{See also|Aquaculture of salmon#Issues|l1=Issues with salmon aquaculture}}
If performed without consideration for potential local environmental impacts, aquaculture in inland waters can result in more environmental damaging than [[wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]], though with less waste produced on a per kg on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, ''Collapse: How societies choose to fail or succeed,'' Viking Press, 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;479–485&lt;/ref&gt; Local concerns with aquaculture in inland waters may include waste handling, side-effects of [[antibiotic]]s, competition between farmed and wild animals, and the potential introduction of [[invasive species|invasive plant and animal species]], or foreign pathogens, particularly if unprocessed fish are used to feed more marketable [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] fish. If non-local live feeds are used, aquaculture may introduce plant of animal.  Improvements in methods resulting from advances in research and the availability of commercial feeds has reduced some of these concerns since their greater prevalence in the 1990s and 2000s .&lt;ref&gt;Costa-Pierce, B.A., 2002, ''Ecological Aquaculture,'' Blackwell Science, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/|title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us|last=le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-11-10|work=|newspaper=New Scientist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish waste is organic and composed of nutrients necessary in all components of aquatic food webs. In-ocean aquaculture often produces much higher  than normal fish waste concentrations. The waste collects on the ocean bottom, damaging or eliminating bottom-dwelling life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2016/04/13/making-fish-farming-more-sustainable/|title=Making Fish Farming More Sustainable - State of the Planet|date=2016-04-13|work=State of the Planet|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste can also decrease [[dissolved oxygen]] levels in the [[water column]], putting further pressure on wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://0-pubs.acs.org.catalog.llu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1021/es0626988 Thacker P, (June 2008) ''Fish Farms Harm Local Food Supply,'' Environmental Science and Technology, V. 40, Issue 11, pp 3445–3446]&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative model to food being added to the ecosystem, is the installation of artificial reef structures to increase the habitat niches available, without the need to add any more than ambient feed and nutrient. This has been used in the "ranching" of abalone in Western Australia.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au-2016-04-23" /&gt;

===Fish oils===
{{further|Tilapia#Nutrition}}

Tilapia from aquaculture has been shown to contain more fat and a much higher ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 oils.

===Impacts on wild fish===
Some carnivorous and omnivorous farmed fish species are fed wild [[forage fish]]. Although carnivorous farmed fish represented only 13 percent of aquaculture production by weight in 2000, they represented 34 percent of aquaculture production by value.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4490e/y4490E01.pdf Aquaculture Production Trends Analysis (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming of carnivorous species like salmon and shrimp leads to a high demand for forage fish to match the nutrition they get in the wild. Fish do not actually produce omega-3 fatty acids, but instead accumulate them from either consuming [[microalgae]] that produce these fatty acids, as is the case with forage fish like [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s, or, as is the case with fatty [[predatory fish]], like salmon, by eating [[prey fish]] that have accumulated [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s from microalgae. To satisfy this requirement, more than 50 percent of the world [[fish oil]] production is fed to farmed salmon.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAO]]: World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2008: [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0250e/i0250e03.pdf Highlights of Special Studies]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmed salmon consume more [[wild fish]] than they generate as a final product, although the efficiency of production is improving. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them - this can be described as the "fish-in-fish-out" (FIFO) ratio. In 1995, salmon had a FIFO ratio of 7.5 (meaning 7.5 pounds of wild fish feed were required to produce 1 pound of salmon); by 2006 the ratio had fallen to 4.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tacon | first1 =  | last2 = Metian | first2 =  | year = 2008 | title = Global overview on the use of fish meal and fish oil in industrially compounded aquafeeds: Trends and future prospects | url = http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/docs/feeds/tacon_etal_global_fishmealoil_overview_2008.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 285 | issue = | pages = 146–158 | doi=10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a growing share of fish oil and fishmeal come from residues (byproducts of fish processing), rather than dedicated whole fish. In 2012, 34 percent of fish oil and 28 percent of fishmeal came from residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/agriculture-and-food/oecd-fao-agricultural-outlook-2014_agr_outlook-2014-en#page191 |title=OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook |year=2014 |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fishmeal and oil from residues instead of whole fish have a different composition with more ash and less protein, which may limit its potential use for aquaculture.

As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when seventy five percent of the worlds monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their [[maximum sustainable yield]].&lt;ref name="Alliance"&gt;[[Seafood Choices Alliance]] (2005) [http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf It's all about salmon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095748/http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming then impacts the survivability of the wild predator fish who rely on them for food. An important step in reducing the impact of aquaculture on wild fish is shifting carnivorous species to plant-based feeds. Salmon feeds, for example, have gone from containing only fishmeal and oil to containing 40 percent plant protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torrissen | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar): The "Super-Chicken" of the Sea? | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10641262.2011.597890#.VgSGaY9VhHw | journal = Reviews in Fisheries Science | volume = 19 | issue = 3| page = 3 | doi=10.1080/10641262.2011.597890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USDA has also experimented with using grain-based feeds for farmed [[trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=21897|title=USDA Grains Project|publisher=USDA ARS}}&lt;/ref&gt; When properly formulated (and often mixed with fishmeal or oil), plant-based feeds can provide proper nutrition and similar growth rates in carnivorous farmed fish.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA/USDA: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/aquaculture/docs/feeds/the_future_of_aquafeeds_final.pdf The Future of Aquafeeds] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another impact aquaculture production can have on wild fish is the risk of fish escaping from coastal pens, where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts, diluting wild genetic stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515132005/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-05-15|title=Oceans|work=davidsuzuki.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escaped fish can become [[invasive species|invasive]], out-competing native species.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Pollution from sea cage aquaculture ====
[[Aquaculture of salmon|Salmon farms]] are typically sited in pristine coastal ecosystems which they then pollute. A farm with 200,000 salmon discharges more fecal waste than a city of 60,000 people. This waste is discharged directly into the surrounding aquatic environment, untreated, often containing antibiotics and [[pesticide]]s."&lt;ref name="Alliance"/&gt; There is also an accumulation of [[heavy metals]] on the [[benthos]] (seafloor) near the salmon farms, particularly [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="FAO coho"&gt;

In 2016, mass fish kill events impacted salmon farmers along Chile's coast and the wider ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/chiles-salmon-farms-lose-800m-as-algal-bloom-kills-millions-of-fish|title=Chile's salmon farms lose $800m as algal bloom kills millions of fish|last=Reuters|date=2016-03-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in aquaculture production and its associated effluent were considered to be possible contributing factors to fish and molluscan mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-04/wave-of-dead-sea-creatures-hits-chile-beaches/7384576|title=Wave of dead sea creatures hits Chile's beaches|date=2016-05-04|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea cage aquaculture is responsible for nutrient enrichment of the waters in which they are established. This results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish. Flushing times, current speeds, distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems.

The extent of the effects of pollution from sea-cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located, which species are kept, how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed. Important species-specific variables include the species' food conversion ratio (FCR) and nitrogen retention. Studies prior to 2001 determined that the amount of nitrogen introduced as feed which is lost to the water column and seafloor as waste varies from 52 to 95%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Genetic modification===
A type of salmon called the AquAdvantage salmon has been [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] for faster growth, although it has not been approved for commercial use, due to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ecological benefits==
While some forms of aquaculture can be devastating to ecosystems, such as shrimp farming in mangroves, other forms can be very beneficial. Shellfish aquaculture adds substantial filter feeding capacity to an environment which can significantly improve water quality. A single oyster can filter 15 gallons of water a day, removing microscopic algal cells. By removing these cells, shellfish are removing nitrogen and other nutrients from the system and either retaining it or releasing it as waste which sinks to the bottom. By harvesting these shellfish the nitrogen they retained is completely removed from the system.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Colleen B., Kurt Stephenson, and Bonnie L. Brown. "Nutrient bioassimilation capacity of aquacultured oysters: quantification of an ecosystem service." Journal of environmental quality 40.1 (2011): 271-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Raising and harvesting kelp and other macroalgae directly remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Repackaging these nutrients can relieve eutrophic, or nutrient-rich, conditions known for their low dissolved oxygen which can decimate species diversity and abundance of marine life. Removing algal cells from the water also increase light penetration, allowing plants such as eelgrass to reestablish themselves and further increase oxygen levels.

Aquaculture in an area can provide for crucial ecological functions for the inhabitants. Shellfish beds or cages can provide habitat structure. This structure can be used as shelter by invertebrates, small fish or crustaceans to potentially increase their abundance and maintain biodiversity. Increased shelter raises stocks of prey fish and small crustaceans by increasing recruitment opportunities in turn providing more prey for higher trophic levels. One study estimated that 10 square meters of oyster reef could enhance an ecosystem's biomass by 2.57&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Charles H., Jonathan H. Grabowski, and Sean P. Powers. "Estimated enhancement of fish production resulting from restoring oyster reef habitat: quantitative valuation." Marine Ecology Progress Series 264 (2003): 249-264.&lt;/ref&gt; The shellfish acting as herbivores will also be preyed on. This moves energy directly from primary producers to higher trophic levels potentially skipping out on multiple energetically-costly trophic jumps which would increase biomass in the ecosystem.

==Animal welfare==
{{see also|Pain in fish|Pain in invertebrates}}
As with the farming of terrestrial animals, social attitudes influence the need for humane practices and regulations in farmed marine animals.  Under the guidelines advised by the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] good animal welfare means both fitness and a sense of well being in the animal's physical and mental state. This can be defined by the [[Five Freedoms]]:
* Freedom from hunger &amp; thirst
* Freedom from discomfort
* Freedom from pain, disease, or injury
* Freedom to express normal behaviour
* Freedom from fear and distress

However, the controversial issue in aquaculture is whether fish and farmed marine invertebrates are actually [[sentient]], or have the perception and awareness to experience suffering. Although no evidence of this has been found in marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name="Hastein"&gt;Hastein, T., Scarfe, A.D. and Lund, V.L. (2005) Science-based assessment of welfare: Aquatic animals. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epiz 24 (2) 529-547&lt;/ref&gt; recent studies conclude that fish do have the necessary receptors ([[nociceptors]]) to sense noxious stimuli and so are likely to experience states of pain, fear and stress.&lt;ref name="Hastein" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandroo, K.P., Duncan, I.J.H. and Moccia, R.D. (2004) "Can fish suffer?: Perspectives on sentience, pain, fear and stress." ''Applied Animal Behaviour Science'' 86 (3,4) 225-250&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, welfare in aquaculture is directed at vertebrates; finfish in particular.&lt;ref name="Conte"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conte | first1 = F.S. | year = 2004 | title = Stress and the welfare of cultured fish | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 86 | issue = 3–4| pages = 205–223 | doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common welfare concerns===
Welfare in aquaculture can be impacted by a number of issues such as stocking densities, behavioural interactions, [[fish diseases and parasites#Disease|disease]] and [[fish diseases and parasites#Parasites|parasitism]]. A major problem in determining the cause of impaired welfare is that these issues are often all interrelated and influence each other at different times.&lt;ref name="Huntingford"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huntingford|first1=F. A.|last2=Adams|first2=C.|last3=Braithwaite|first3=V. A.|last4=Kadri|first4=S.|last5=Pottinger|first5=T. G.|last6=Sandoe|first6=P.|last7=Turnbull|first7=J.

Optimal stocking density is often defined by the [[carrying capacity]] of the stocked environment and the amount of individual space needed by the fish, which is very species specific. Although behavioural interactions such as [[shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species,&lt;ref name="Hastein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;Ashley, P.J. (2006) Fish welfare: Current issues in aquaculture. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, {{doi|10.1016/j.applanim.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many cultured species high stocking densities may be of concern. Crowding can constrain normal swimming behaviour, as well as increase aggressive and competitive behaviours such as cannibalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baras E, Jobling M |year=2002 |title=Dynamics of intracohort cannibalism in cultured fish |journal=Aquaculture Research |volume=33 |issue=7 |pages=461–479 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00732.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; feed competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greaves K. |author2=Tuene S. | year = 2001 | title = The form and context of aggressive behaviour in farmed Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 193 | issue = 1–2| pages = 139–147 | doi = 10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00476-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; territoriality and dominance/subordination hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; This potentially increases the risk of tissue damage due to abrasion from fish-to-fish contact or fish-to-cage contact.&lt;ref name="Hastein" /&gt; Fish can suffer reductions in food intake and [[feed conversion ratio|food conversion efficiency]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ellis T. |author2=North B. |author3=Scott A.P. |author4=Bromage N.R. |author5=Porter M. |author6=Gadd D. | year = 2002 | title = The relationships between stocking density and welfare in farmed rainbow trout | url = | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 493–531 | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2002.tb00893.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, high stocking densities can result in water flow being insufficient, creating inadequate oxygen supply and waste product removal.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; [[Dissolved oxygen]] is essential for fish respiration and concentrations below critical levels can induce stress and even lead to [[asphyxiation]].&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt; Ammonia, a nitrogen excretion product, is highly toxic to fish at accumulated levels, particularly when oxygen concentrations are low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Remen M. |author2=Imsland A.K. |author3=Steffansson S.O. |author4=Jonassen T.M. |author5=Foss A. | year = 2008 | title = Interactive effects of ammonia and oxygen on growth and physiological status of juvenile Atlantic cod (''Gadus morhua'') | url = | journal = Aquaculture | volume = 274 | issue = 2–4| pages = 292–299 | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.11.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these interactions and effects cause stress in the fish, which can be a major factor in facilitating fish disease.&lt;ref name="Conte" /&gt; For many parasites, infestation depends on the host's degree of mobility, the density of the host population and vulnerability of the host's defence system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paperna I | year = 1991 | title = Diseases caused by parasites in the aquaculture of warm water fish | url = | journal = Annual Review of Fish Diseases | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 155–194 | doi = 10.1016/0959-8030(91)90028-I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lice are the primary parasitic problem for finfish in aquaculture, high numbers causing widespread skin erosion and haemorrhaging, gill congestion, and increased mucus production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson S.C. |author2=Treasurer J.W. |author3=Bravo S. |author4=Nagasawa K. |author5=Kabata Z. | year = 2004 | title = A review of the impact of parasitic copepods on marine aquaculture | url = | journal = Zoological Studies | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 229–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of prominent viral and bacterial [[pathogen]]s that can have severe effects on internal organs and nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johansen L.H. |author2=Jensen I. |author3=Mikkelsen H. |author4=Bjorn P.A. |author5=Jansen P.A. |author6=Bergh O. | year = 2011 | title = Disease interaction and pathogens exchange between wild and farmed fish populations with special reference to Norway | url = https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/11250/108947/1/Aquacult_315_3-4_2011_167-186.pdf| journal = Aquaculture | volume = 315 | issue = 3–4| pages = 167–186 | doi = 10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.02.014 |hdl=11250/117164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving welfare===
The key to improving welfare of marine cultured organisms is to reduce stress to a minimum, as prolonged or repeated stress can cause a range of adverse effects. Attempts to minimise stress can occur throughout the culture process. During grow out it is important to keep stocking densities at appropriate levels specific to each species, as well as separating size classes and grading to reduce aggressive behavioural interactions. Keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation.

Not surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures. However, prevention methods, such as vaccination, can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; Other methods include adding antibiotics to feed, adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control, such as using [[cleaner fish|cleaner wrasse]] to remove lice from farmed salmon.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

Many steps are involved in transport, including capture, food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water, transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps, plus transport and transfer to the delivery location. During transport water needs to be maintained to a high quality, with regulated temperature, sufficient oxygen and minimal waste products.&lt;ref name="Conte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt; In some cases [[anaesthetics]] may be used in small doses to calm fish before transport.&lt;ref name="Ashley" /&gt;

Aquaculture is sometimes part of an environmental rehabilitation program or as an aid in conserving endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ0eOg8ld5QC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=aquaculture+and+rehabilitation+and+ex-situ&amp;ots=qq9b_fMvvc&amp;sig=itYIabSe1EVCbLZW3j-U99qk_fc&amp;ei=0ph1T8LqJOKp0QXx3qGkDQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA&amp;q=aquaculture%20and%20rehabilitation%20and%20ex-situ|title=Aquaculture Development|work=google.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prospects==
Global [[wild fisheries]] are in decline, with valuable habitat such as [[estuary|estuaries]] in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tietenberg, Tom]] (2006) ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Page 28. Pearson/Addison Wesley. {{ISBN|978-0-321-30504-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aquaculture or [[fish farm|farming]] of [[piscivorous]] fish, like [[salmon]], does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as [[fish meal]] and [[fish oil]]. Studies have shown that [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon farming]] has major [[Salmon farming issues|negative impacts]] on wild salmon, as well as the [[forage fish]] that need to be caught to feed them.&lt;ref name="Salmon Run"&gt;

Apart from fish and shrimp, some aquaculture undertakings, such as seaweed and filter-feeding bivalve mollusks like [[oyster]]s, [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s and [[scallop]]s, are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative.&lt;ref name="uscnews.usc.edu"/&gt; Filter-feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water, improving water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Vaccine]]s are being used more and more to reduce [[antibiotic]] use for disease control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050106122419/http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/12217/marine_aquaculture_pew_2001.pdf "Pew Oceans Commission report on Aquaculture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using [[polyculture]] techniques, and properly sited facilities (for example, offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects.

[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] (RAS) recycle water by circulating it through filters to remove fish waste and food and then recirculating it back into the tanks.  This saves water and the waste gathered can be used in [[compost]] or, in some cases, could even be treated and used on land. While RAS was developed with freshwater fish in mind, scientist associated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have found a way to rear saltwater fish using RAS in low-salinity waters.&lt;ref name="Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!"&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/feb09/seafood0209.htm
|title=Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!
|publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service
|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although saltwater fish are raised in off-shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt), scientists were able to produce healthy pompano, a saltwater fish, in tanks with a salinity of only 5 ppt. Commercializing low-salinity RAS are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects. Unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm-raised fish would greatly be reduced. The price of expensive saltwater fish, such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments, would be reduced. However, before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish's lifecycle, including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water, what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle, the [[stocking rate]] that will produce the healthiest fish, etc.&lt;ref name="Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!"/&gt;

Brown, ''[[Plan B 2.0]] Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble'' (NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2006), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In California, for example, 15 fish farms produce tilapia, bass, and catfish with warm water from underground. This warmer water enables fish to grow all year round and mature more quickly. Collectively these California farms produce 4.5 million kilograms of fish each year.&lt;ref name="earth-policy" /&gt;

The '''water buffalo''' (''Bubalus bubalis'') or '''domestic Asian water buffalo''' is a large [[bovid]] originating in [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[China]]. Today, it is also found in [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[North America]], [[South America]] and some [[Africa]]n countries.&lt;ref name=Cockrill1977&gt;{{cite book |author=Cockrill, W.

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wild water buffalo]] (''Bubalus arnee'') native to [[Southeast Asia]] is considered a different [[Species (biology)|species]], but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lau, C.

Two extant [[Type (biology)|types]] of domestic water buffalo are recognized based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Ethology|behavioural]] criteria – the '''river buffalo''' of South Asia and further west to the [[Balkans]], [[Egypt]], and [[Italy]], and the '''swamp buffalo''', found from [[Assam]] in the west through Southeast Asia to the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] valley of China in the east.&lt;ref name=Cockrill1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cockrill1974&gt;{{cite book |author=Cockrill, W.

At least 130 million domestic water buffalo exist, and more people depend on them than on any other [[domestic animal]].&lt;ref&gt;Scherf, B. D. (2000). ''World watch list for domestic animal diversity''. Third edition. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;
They are especially suitable for [[Tillage|tilling]] [[rice field]]s, and their [[milk]] is richer in [[fat]] and [[protein]] than that of [[dairy cattle]]. The large [[feral]] population of northern Australia became established in the late 19th century, and smaller feral herds are in [[New Guinea]], [[Tunisia]], and northeastern [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name= Cockrill1977/&gt;
Feral herds are also present in [[New Britain]], [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, (2011), The feral water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) Invasive species fact sheet, [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/publications/factsheet-feral-water-buffalo-bubalus-bubalis]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[Irian Jaya]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Colombia]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Brazil]], and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, J.

==Characteristics==

[[File:Albino Water Buffalo, Chiang Mai.jpg|thumb|An albino swamp buffalo in [[Chiang Mai province]], Thailand]]
The skin of river buffalo is black, but some specimens may have dark, slate-coloured skin. Swamp buffalo have a grey skin at birth, but become slate blue later. [[Albinism|Albinoids]] are present in some populations. River buffalo have comparatively longer faces, smaller girths, and bigger limbs than swamp buffalo. Their dorsal ridges extend further back and taper off more gradually. Their horns grow downward and backward, then curve upward in a spiral. Swamp buffalo are heavy-bodied and stockily built; the body is short and the belly large. The forehead is flat, the eyes prominent, the face short, and the [[snout|muzzle]] wide. The neck is comparatively long, and the [[withers]] and [[Rump (animal)|croup]] are prominent. A dorsal ridge extends backward and ends abruptly just before the end of the chest. Their horns grow outward, and curve in a semicircle, but always remain more or less on the plane of the forehead. The tail is short, reaching only to the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]]s. Height at withers is {{convert|129|-|133|cm|in|abbr=on}} for males, and {{convert|120|-|127|cm|in|abbr=on}} for females. They range in weight from {{convert|300|-|550|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but weights of over {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} have also been observed.&lt;ref name="Cockrill1977" /&gt;

''Tedong bonga'' is a black pied buffalo featuring a unique black and white colouration that is favoured by the [[Toraja]] of [[Sulawesi]].&lt;ref&gt;Priyanto, D., Suradissastra, K. (2010). [http://peternakan.litbang.deptan.go.id/fullteks/lokakarya/lkerbau10-29.pdf ''Ko-evolusi dan Panarchy: Integrasi Ternak Kerbau dalam Sistem Sosial Etnis Toraja'']. Seminar dan Lokakarya Nasional Kerbau 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The swamp buffalo has 48 [[chromosomes]]; the river buffalo has 50 chromosomes. The two types do not readily interbreed, but fertile offspring can occur. Buffalo-[[cattle]] hybrids have not been observed to occur, but the embryos of such hybrids reach maturity in laboratory experiments, albeit at lower rates than non-hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kochhar, H. P., Rao, K. B., Luciano, A. M., Totey, S. M., Gandolfi, F., Basrur, P. K., King, W. A. |year=2002 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=6A10524591280A73D12B7D4818786EAB.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=109213 |title=In vitro production of cattle-water buffalo (''Bos taurus'' - ''Bubalus bubalis'') hybrid embryos |journal=Zygote |volume=102 |pages=155–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rumen]] of the water buffalo has important differences from that of other [[ruminant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wanapat, M.; Ngarmsang, A.; Korkhuntot, S.; Nontaso, N.; Wachirapakorn, C.; Beakes, G.; Rowlinson, P.  (2000). ''A comparative study on the rumen microbial population of cattle and swamp buffalo raised under traditional village conditions in the northeast of Thailand''. Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences 13 (7): 918–921.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a larger population of [[bacteria]], particularly the [[cellulolytic]] bacteria, lower [[protozoa]], and higher [[fungi]] [[zoospore]]s. In addition, higher rumen [[ammonia]] [[nitrogen]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N) and higher [[pH]] have been found as compared to those in [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mekarn.org/procbuf/wanapat.htm |title=Swamp buffalo rumen ecology and its manipulation |author=Wanapat, M. |year=2001 |work=Proceedings Buffalo Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Water buffalo.jpg|thumb|Water buffalo enjoy being in water.]]
[[File:Flickr - Rainbirder - Water Buffalo.jpg|thumb|Water buffalo wallowing in mud]]
River buffalo prefer deep water. Swamp buffalo prefer to [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mudholes which they make with their horns. During wallowing, they acquire a thick coating of mud.&lt;ref name= Cockrill1977/&gt; Both are well adapted to a hot and humid climate with temperatures ranging from {{convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}} in the winter to {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}} and greater in the summer. Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in [[thermoregulation]]. Some [[breed]]s are adapted to [[Saline water|saline]] seaside shores and [[Soil salinity|saline sandy terrain]].&lt;ref name=Borghese2005/&gt;

===Diet===
Water buffalo thrive on many [[aquatic plant]]s and during floods, will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. They eat [[Reed (plant)|reeds]], ''[[Arundo donax]]'', a kind of ''[[Cyperaceae]]'', ''[[Eichhornia crassipes]]'', and ''[[Juncaceae]]''. Some of these plants are of great value to local peoples.  Others, such as ''E. crassipes'', are a major problem in some tropical valleys and water buffalo may help to keep waterways clear.

Green fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include [[alfalfa]], the leaves, stems or trimmings of [[banana]], [[cassava]], [[Mangelwurzel]], [[esparto]], ''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'' and [[kenaf]], [[maize]], [[oat]]s, ''[[Pandanus]]'', [[peanut]], [[sorghum]], [[soybean]], [[sugarcane]], [[bagasse]], and [[turnip]]s. [[Citrus]] pulp and [[pineapple]] wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried [[Date palm#Dates|dates]] are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% of the standard feed mixture.&lt;ref name= Cockrill1977/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Water buffalo calf, India.jpg|thumb|left|A water buffalo calf in [[India]]]]
Swamp buffalo generally become [[Reproduction|reproductive]] at an older age than river breeds. Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.0–3.5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age. Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older. A good river male can impregnate 100 females in a year. A strong seasonal influence on [[mating]] occurs. Heat stress reduces [[libido]].&lt;ref name= Cockrill1977/&gt;

Although buffalo are polyoestrous, their reproductive efficiency shows wide variation throughout the year. Buffalo cows exhibit a distinct seasonal change in displaying [[oestrus]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] rate, and [[calf (animal)|calving]] rate.&lt;ref name=Barile2005&gt;Barile, V. L. (2005). ''Reproductive Efficiency in Female Buffaloes''. Pages 77–108 in Borghese, A. (ed.) [http://www.cienciaanimal.ufpa.br/CA_selecao/M/2010/biblio/Prod/complem/Borghese_2005.pdf ''Buffalo Production and Research'']. REU Technical Series 67. Inter-regional Cooperative Research Network on Buffalo, FAO Regional Office for Europe, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The age at first oestrus of [[Cattle#Terminology|heifer]]s varies between breeds from 13–33 months, but mating at the first oestrus is often infertile and usually deferred until they are 3 years old. [[Gestation]] lasts from 281–334 days, but most reports give a range between 300 and 320 days. Swamp buffalo carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffalo. It is not rare to find buffalo that continue to work well at the age of 30, and  instances of a working life of 40 years are recorded.&lt;ref name= Cockrill1977/&gt;

==Taxonomic history==
[[File:09963 Water buffalo.JPG|thumbnail|Water buffalo]]
[[Carl Linnaeus]] first described the genus ''[[Bos]]'' and the water buffalo under the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Bos bubalis'' in 1758; the species was known to occur in Asia and was held as a domestic form in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Linnaeus, C. |year=1758 |chapter=Bos Bubalis |title=Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentii Salvii |chapterurl=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726975 |edition=10 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sir John Ellerman, 1st Baronet|Ellerman]] and [[Terence Morrison-Scott|Morrison-Scott]] treated the wild and domestic forms of the water buffalo as [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellerman, J.R., Morrison-Scott, T. C. S. |year=1966 |chapter=Genus ''Bubalus'' H. Smith, 1827 |title=Checklist of Palaearctic and Indian mammals 1758 to 1946 |location=London |publisher=British Museum of Natural History |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/checklistofindia00elle#page/382/mode/2up |edition=Second |pages=383–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others treated them as different [[Species (biology)|species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Corbet, G.B. and Hill, J.E. |year=1987 |title= A World List of Mammalian Species, Second edition |publisher=British Natural History Museum |location= London | isbn=0565009885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclatorial]] treatment of wild and domestic forms has been inconsistent and varies between authors and even within the works of single authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Groves, C. P. |year=1971 |url= https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/12224482 |title=Request for a declaration modifying Article 1 so as to exclude names proposed for domestic animals from Zoological Nomenclature |journal= Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature |volume=27 |pages=269–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2003, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] achieved consistency in the naming of wild and domestic water buffalo by ruling that the [[scientific name]] ''Bubalus arnee'' is valid for the wild form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=2003 |title=Opinion 2027 (Case 3010).

== Domestication and breeding ==
[[File:Murrah buffalo.JPG|thumb|Murrah buffalo at the [[Philippine Carabao Center]]]]
Water buffalo were [[Domestication|domesticated]] in Indian subcontinent about 5000 years ago, and in China about 4000 years ago. Two types are recognized, based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and behavioural criteria – the '''river buffalo''' of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans and Italy, and the '''swamp buffalo''', found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east.&lt;ref name=Cockrill1974 /&gt;
The present-day river buffalo is the result of complex domestication processes involving more than one maternal lineage and a significant maternal [[gene flow]] from wild populations after the initial domestication events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kumar, S., Nagarajan, M., Sandhu, J.

Twenty-two [[breed]]s of the river type water buffalo are known, including [[Murrah buffalo|Murrah]], [[NiliRavi]], [[Surti buffalo|Surti]], Jafarabadi, Anatolian, Mediterranean, and Egyptian buffalo.&lt;ref name=Moioli2005&gt;Moioli, B. and A.

[[Sequencing]] of [[cytochrome b]] [[gene]]s of ''Bubalus'' [[Species (biology)|species]] implies that the domestic buffalo originated from at least two populations, and that the river and the swamp types have differentiated at the full species level. The [[genetic distance]] between the two types is so large that a divergence time of about 1.7 million years has been suggested. The swamp type was noticed to have the closest relationship with the [[tamaraw]].&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K., Solis, C. D., Masangkay, J. S., Maeda, K., Kawamoto, I. Y. and Namikawa, T. (1996).

== Distribution of populations ==
[[File:Philippine Carabao.jpg|thumb|[[Carabao]] buffalo in the Philippines]]

===In Asia===
[[File:Carabao Cart.jpg|thumb|Carabao cart in the [[Philippines]] in 1899]]
More than 95.8% of the world population of water buffalo are kept in Asia, including both river and swamp types.&lt;ref name=Borghese2005&gt;Borghese, A., Mazzi, M. (2005). ''Buffalo Population and Strategies in the World''. Pages 1–39 in Borghese, A. (ed.) ''Buffalo Production and Research''. REU Technical Series 67. Inter-regional Cooperative Research Network on Buffalo, FAO Regional Office for Europe, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;
The water buffalo population in [[India]] numbered over 97.9 million head in 2003, representing 56.5% of the world population. They are primarily of the river type, with 10 well-defined breeds comprising Badhawari, Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Jafarabadi, Marathwada, Mehsana, Nagpuri, Pandharpuri, Toda, and Surti. Swamp buffalo occur only in small areas in [[Northeast India|north-eastern India]] and are not distinguished into breeds.&lt;ref name= Singh2010&gt;Singh, C. V. and R. S. Barwal (2010).

Proceedings of the 9th World Buffalo Congress, Buenos Aires, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the second-largest population lived in China, with 22.76 million head, all of the swamp type with breeds kept only in the lowlands, and other breeds kept only in the mountains; as of 2003, 3.2 million swamp-type [[carabao]] buffalo were in the Philippines, nearly three million swamp buffalo were in [[Vietnam]], and 772,764 buffalo were in [[Bangladesh]]. About 750,000 head were estimated in [[Sri Lanka]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Borghese2005/&gt; In Japan, water buffalo is domestic animal throughout the Ryukyuan islands or Okinawa prefecture. It was also recorded that 889,246 buffalo were in [[Nepal]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In [[Thailand]], the number of water buffalo dropped from more than 3 million head in 1996 to less than 1.24 million head in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Uriyapongson, S. (2013). Buffalo and Buffalo Meat in Thailand. Buffalo Bulletin 32: 329–332.&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly over 75% of them are kept in the country's northeastern region. The statistics also indicate that by the beginning of 2012, less than one million were in the country, partly as a result of illegal shipments to neighboring countries where sales prices are higher than in Thailand.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Water buffalo are also present in the southern region of [[Iraq]] in the [[Mesopotamian Marshes]]. The [[draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes]] by [[Saddam Hussein]] was an attempt to punish the south for the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]]. After 2003 and the [[Firdos Square statue destruction]], these lands were reflooded and a 2007 report on [[Maysan Governorate|Maysan]] and [[Dhi Qar Governorate|Dhi Qar]] shows a steady increase in the number of water buffalo. The report puts the number at 40,008 head in those two provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abid|first1=H. |title=Water Buffalo in the Iraqi Marshes|journal=Nature Iraq|date=2007|pages=29|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe and the Mediterranean ===
[[File:Kerkini lake - Kerkini village.jpg|right|thumb|Water buffaloes in [[Lake Kerkini]]]]
Water buffalo were probably introduced to [[Europe]] from India or other eastern sources. In [[Italy]], the [[Longobard]] King [[Agilulf]] is said to have received water buffalo in about the year 600. These were probably a present from the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], a [[Turkic people|Turkic]] nomadic tribe that dwelt near the [[Danube River]] at the time. [[Harry Johnston|Sir H. Johnston]] knew of a herd of water buffalo presented by a [[King of Naples]] to the [[Bey of Tunis]] in the mid-19th century that had resumed the [[feral]] state in northern [[Tunis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lydekker, R. |year=1898 |title=Wild Oxen, Sheep, and Goats of all Lands |chapter=The Indian buffalo – ''Bos bubalis'' |url=https://archive.org/stream/wildoxensheepgoa00lyde#page/118/mode/2up |publisher=Rowland Ward |location= London |pages=118–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European buffalo are all of the river type and considered to be of the same breed named Mediterranean buffalo. In Italy, the Mediterranean type was particularly selected and is called [[Mediterranea Italiana|Mediterranean Italian breed]] to distinguish it from other European breeds, which differ genetically. Mediterranean buffalo are also kept in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], and the [[Republic of Macedonia]], with a few hundred in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Hungary]]. Little exchange of breeding buffalo has occurred among countries, so each population has its own [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] features and performances. In Bulgaria, they were crossbred with the Indian Murrah breed, and in Romania, some were crossbred with Bulgarian Murrah.&lt;ref name=Borghese2005/&gt;
Populations in [[Turkey]] are of the Anatolian buffalo breed.&lt;ref name=Moioli2005/&gt;

===In Australia===
[[File:WildWaterBuffalo(Bubalus bubalis arnee).jpg|right|thumb|A feral water buffalo in Australia]]
Between 1824 and 1849, water buffalo were introduced into the [[Northern Territory]] from [[Timor]], [[Kisar]], and probably other islands in the [[Indonesian archipelago]]. In 1886, a few milking types were brought from India to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. They have been the main grazing animals on the subcoastal plains and river basins between Darwin and [[Arnhem Land]] since the 1880s. In the early 1960s, an estimated population of 150,000 to 200,000 buffalo were living in the plains and nearby areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Letts, G. A. |year=1964 |title=Feral Animals in the Northern Territory |journal= Australian Veterinary Journal |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages= 84–88 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-0813.1964.tb01703.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They became feral and are causing significant environmental damage. Buffalo also occur in the [[Top End]]. As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980. The commencement of the [[brucellosis]] and [[tuberculosis]] campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s. The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997. Numbers dropped dramatically as a result of the campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/b4a187ba-7a72-4ed2-ab06-7a8b8a1b87a0/files/buffalo.pdf The feral water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)]. Fact Sheet. Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Retrieved on 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the 1950s, buffalo were hunted for their skins and meat, which was exported and used in the local trade. In the late 1970s, live exports were made to [[Cuba]] and continued later into other countries. Buffalo are now crossed with riverine buffalo in [[artificial insemination]] programs, and are kept in many areas of Australia. Some of these [[crossbred]]s are used for milk production. [[Melville Island (Northern Territory)|Melville Island]] is a popular hunting location, where a steady population up to 4,000 individuals exists. Safari outfits are run from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] to Melville Island and other locations in the Top End, often with the use of [[bush pilot]]s. The horns, which can measure up to a record of {{convert|3.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tip-to-tip, are prized hunting trophies.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;Sharp, K. (2009). Frontier to the Crossroads. ''Outback Magazine'' 67:&lt;/ref&gt;

The buffalo have developed a different appearance from the Indonesian buffalo from which they descend.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} They live mainly in freshwater marshes and [[billabong]]s, and their territory range can be quite expansive during the [[wet season]]. Their only natural predators in Australia are adult [[saltwater crocodile]]s, with whom they share the billabongs, and [[dingo]]es, which have been known to prey on buffalo calves and occasionally adult buffalo when the dingoes are in large packs.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Buffalo were exported live to Indonesia until 2011, at a rate of about 3000 per year. After the live export ban that year, the exports dropped to zero, and had not resumed as of June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;ABC website [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/buffalo-exports-still-suffering/4743474 Buffalo exports still suffering June 10, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In South America===
[[File:Búfalo Murrah.JPG|thumb|Murrah buffalo in a Brazilian Farm]]
Water buffalo were introduced into the [[Amazon River]] basin in 1895. They are now extensively used there for meat and dairy production. In 2005, the buffalo herd in the [[Brazil]]ian Amazon stood at roughly 1.6 million head, of which 460,000 were located in the lower Amazon floodplain.&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh, P. A., Merry, F.

In Argentina, many game ranches raise water buffalo for commercial hunting.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===In North America===
In 1974, four water buffalo were imported to the [[United States]] from [[Guam]] to be studied at the [[University of Florida]]. In February 1978, the first herd arrived for commercial farming. Until 2002, only one commercial breeder was in the United States. Water buffalo meat is imported from Australia.&lt;ref name= NRC/&gt;
Until 2011, water buffalo were raised in [[Gainesville, Florida]], from young obtained from zoo overflow. They were used primarily for meat production, frequently sold as hamburger.&lt;ref&gt;"Buffalos find home on the kitchen range // Sought-after meat lower than beef in cholesterol, fat" (1989).

== Husbandry ==
[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|left|Water buffalo ploughing [[rice fields]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]
[[File:Child and ox ploughing, Laos (1).jpg|thumb|Water buffalo are used for [[ploughing]] in [[Si Phan Don]], [[Laos]].]]

The husbandry system of water buffalo depends on the purpose for which they are bred and maintained. Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their buffalo live in very close association with them, and are often their greatest [[capital asset]]. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places. Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of [[paddy field]]s because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as "the living tractor of the East". It probably is possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as [[pack animal]]s, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a [[fertilizer]], and as a [[fuel]] when dried.&lt;ref name= Cockrill1977/&gt;

Buffalo contribute 72 million tones of [[milk]] and three million tones of [[meat]] annually to world food, much of it in areas that are prone to nutritional imbalances. In India, river-type buffalo are kept mainly for milk production and for transport, whereas swamp-type buffalo are kept mainly for work and a small amount of milk.&lt;ref name= Singh2010/&gt;

=== Dairy products ===

Water buffalo milk presents physicochemical features different from that of other [[ruminant]] species, such as a higher content of [[fatty acid]]s and [[protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ambrosio, C., Arena, S., Salzano, A.

Water buffalo milk contains higher levels of total solids, [[crude protein]], [[milk fat|fat]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]], and slightly higher content of [[lactose]] compared with those of [[cow milk]]. The high level of total solids makes water buffalo milk ideal for processing into value-added dairy products such as [[cheese]]. The [[conjugated linoleic acid]] (CLA) content in milk ranged from 4.4&amp;nbsp;mg/g fat in September to 7.6&amp;nbsp;mg/g fat in June. Seasons and genetics may play a role in variation of CLA level and changes in gross composition of the water buffalo milk.&lt;ref&gt;Han, X., Lee, F. L., Zhang, L. and M. R. Guo (2012).

=== Meat and skin products ===
{{main|Buffalo meat}}
Water buffalo meat, sometimes called "carabeef", is often passed off as beef in certain regions, and is also a major source of export revenue for India. In many Asian regions, buffalo meat is less preferred due to its toughness; however, recipes have evolved (''[[rendang]]'', for example) where the slow cooking process and spices not only make the meat palatable, but also preserve it, an important factor in hot climates where refrigeration is not always available.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Their hides provide tough and useful [[leather]], often used for shoes&lt;!-- and [[motorcycle]] [[helmets]] --&gt;.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Bone and horn products ===
[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|A [[bihu]] dancer is blowing a [[hornpipe (instrument)|hornpipe]].]]
The bones and horns are often made into jewellery, especially earrings. Horns are used for the embouchure of musical instruments, such as ''[[ney]]'' and ''[[kaval]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Wear Horn Earrings?|url=http://bandaruorganics.com/buffalo-horn-earrings.pdf|publisher=Bandaru Organics|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental effects==
[[Wildlife conservation]] scientists have started to recommend and use introduced populations of feral domestic water buffalo in far-away lands to manage uncontrolled vegetation growth in and around natural [[wetland]]s. Introduced water buffalo at home in such environs provide cheap service by regularly grazing the uncontrolled vegetation and opening up clogged water bodies for [[waterfowl]], wetland birds, and other wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News February 2004 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/mid_/3483395.stm ''Buffalo improve wildlife habitat'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/forum/forum_buffalos.htm "Buffaloes and wetlands" -- grazing in wetland management: A discussion from the Ramsar Forum over late March 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Grazing water buffalo are sometimes used in [[Great Britain]] for [[conservation grazing]], such as in Chippenham Fen National Nature Reserve. The buffalo can better adapt to wet conditions and poor-quality vegetation than cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=[[Natural England]] |year=2008 | title=Buffalo improve wildlife habitat in Cambridgeshire | url=http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/buffalo_improve_wildlife_habitat_in_cambridgeshire/42972.html | publisher=Natural England East of England press office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, research is being conducted at the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] to determine the levels of nutrients removed and returned to wetlands when water buffalo are used for wetland vegetation management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

However, in uncontrolled circumstances, water buffalo can cause environmental damage, such as trampling vegetation, disturbing bird and reptile nesting sites, and spreading exotic weeds.&lt;ref name="Roth, J. and P.

[[File:Pcc22jf.JPG|thumb|The super carabaos at the milking and breeding station]]
In 2007, the development of [[Southeast Asia]]'s first [[Cloning|cloned]] buffalo was announced in the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture's [[Philippine Carabao Center]] implemented cloning through [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as a tool for genetic improvement in water buffalo to produce "super buffalo calves" by multiplying existing [[germplasm]]s but without modifying or altering [[gene]]tic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hicap|first=J.

In January 2008, the Philippine Carabao Center in [[Nueva Ecija]], per [[Filipino people|Filipino]] scientists, initiated a study to breed a super water buffalo that could produce 4 to 18 litres of milk per day using gene-based technology. Also, the first ''in vitro'' river buffalo was born there in 2004 from an ''in vitro''-produced, vitrified embryo, named "Glory" after President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. [[Joseph Estrada]]'s most successful project as an opposition senator, the PCC was created through Republic Act 3707, the Carabao Act of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20071231-109740/Super_carabao_making_the_scene_in_year_of_the_rats|title='Super carabao' making the scene in year of the rats |date=2007 |first=Jocelyn |last=Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian scientists from the [[National Dairy Research Institute]], [[Karnal]] developed a cloned buffalo in 2010. The buffalo calf was named Samrupa. The calf did not survive more than a week, due to [[genetic defect]]s. A few months later, a second cloned calf was successfully born, named Garima.&lt;ref&gt;Samrupa, World's first cloned buffalo calf from India.

* Carabao Carroza Festival is being held annually every May in the town of [[Pavia, Iloilo|Pavia]], [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]].
* [[Kambala]] races of [[Karnataka]], [[India]], take place between December and March. The races are conducted by having the water buffalo (he buffalo) run in long parallel slushy ditches, where they are driven by men standing on wooden planks drawn by the buffalo. The objectives of the race are to finish first and to raise the water to the greatest height and also a rural sport. Kambala races are arranged with competition, as well as without competition and as a part of thanks giving (to god) in about 50 villages of coastal Karnataka.
*In the [[Chonburi Province]] of [[Thailand]], and in [[Pakistan]], there are annual water buffalo races.

About 300 buffalo race in groups of five or six, spurred on by bareback jockeys wielding wooden sticks, as hundreds of spectators cheer. The water buffalo has always played an important role in agriculture in Thailand. For farmers of Chon Buri Province, near Bangkok, it is an important annual festival, beginning in mid-October. It is also a celebration among rice farmers before the rice harvest. At dawn, farmers walk their buffalo through surrounding rice fields, splashing them with water to keep them cool before leading them to the race field. This amazing festival started over a hundred years ago when two men arguing about whose buffalo was the fastest ended up having a race between them. That’s how it became a tradition and gradually a social event for farmers who gathered from around the country in Chonburi to trade their goods. The festival also helps a great deal in preserving the number of buffalo, which have been dwindling at quite an alarming rate in other regions. Modern machinery is rapidly replacing buffalo in Thai agriculture. With most of the farm work mechanized, the buffalo-racing tradition has continued. Racing buffalo are now raised just to race; they do not work at all. The few farm buffalo which still do work are much bigger than the racers because of the strenuous work they perform. Farm buffalo are in the "Buffalo Beauty Pageant", a Miss Farmer beauty contest and a comic buffalo costume contest etc.. This festival perfectly exemplifies a favored Thai attitude to life — "sanuk," meaning fun.
* [[Babulang]] Water buffalo racing festival in [[Sarawak]], Malaysia, is the largest or grandest of the many rituals, ceremonies and festivals of the traditional [[Bisaya (Borneo)|Bisaya]] community of Limbang, Sarawak. Highlights are the Ratu Babulang competition and the Water buffalo races which can only be found in this town in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].

There was a time when many village cattle which provide rural Cambodians with muscle power to plough their fields and transport agricultural products died from an unknown disease. The villagers prayed to a spirit to help save their animals from the disease and promised to show their gratitude by holding a buffalo race each year on the last day of "P'chum Ben" festival as it is known in Cambodian. The race draws hundreds of spectators who come to see riders and their animals charge down the racing field, the racers bouncing up and down on the backs of their buffalo, whose horns were draped with colorful cloth.

The '''Bali cattle''' (''Bos javanicus domesticus'') also known as '''Balinese cattle''' are a domesticated form of the [[Banteng|Javan banteng]]. Bali cattle were an important source of [[meat]] and were used for [[plowing]].

==Introduction==
The Bali cattle were introduced to [[East Timor]], [[Java]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Australia]] including the [[Northern Territory]] as livestock but they escaped from captivity and started to increase in large numbers and damaging crops.

The '''dromedary''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|ɒ|m|ə|d|ɛ|ɹ|i}} or {{IPAc-en|-|ə|d|r|i}}), also called the '''Arabian camel''' (''Camelus dromedarius''), is a large, [[even-toed ungulate]] with one hump on its back. The dromedary is the tallest of the three species of [[camel]]; adult males stand {{convert|1.8|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, while females are {{convert|1.7|–|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Males  typically weigh between {{convert|400|and|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and females weigh between {{convert|300|and|540|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The species' distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump (compared with two on the [[Bactrian camel]] and [[wild Bactrian camel]]), and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall or more, is made of fat bound together by [[fibrous tissue]].

Dromedaries are mainly active during daylight hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a [[Dominance (ethology)|dominant]] male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a [[gestation]] of 15 months.

The dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first [[Domestication of animals|domesticated]] in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the [[Sahara Desert]]. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a [[beast of burden]].

==Etymology==
The common name "dromedary" comes from the [[Old French]] ''dromedaire'' or the [[Late Latin]] ''dromedarius''. These originated from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''dromas'', δρομάς (ο, η) (&lt;small&gt;[[genitive|GEN (γενική)]]&lt;/small&gt; ''dromados'', δρομάδος), meaning "running" or "runner",&lt;ref name="LSJ"&gt;{{LSJ|droma/s|δρομάς|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{OxfordDictionaries.com|Dromedary|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in Greek in the combination {{lang|grc|δρομάς κάμηλος}} (''dromas kamelos''), literally "running camel", to refer to the dromedary.&lt;ref name="LSJ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|dromedary|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use in English of the name "dromedary" occurred in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="English dromedary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=L.|last2=Humez|first2=A.|last3=Dror|first3=M.|title=The Private Lives of  Words|year=1984|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7102-0006-8|edition=1st|location=Abingdon, UK|pages=58–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dromedary possibly originated in Arabia and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Arabian camel.&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt; The word "camel" generally refers either to the dromedary or the [[Conspecificity|congeneric]] [[Bactrian camel|Bactrian]]; it may have been derived from the Latin word ''camelus'', the Greek ''kamēlos'',&lt;ref&gt;{{OxfordDictionaries.com|Camel|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an old [[Semitic language]] such as the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''gāmāl'' or the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''ǧamal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Camel|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dromedary shares the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Camelus]]'' with the Bactrian camel (''C. bactrianus'') and the wild Bactrian camel (''C. ferus''). The dromedary belongs to the family [[Camelidae]].&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt;&lt;ref name=colin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groves|first1=C.|last2=Grubb|first2=P.|authorlink1=Colin Groves|authorlink2=Peter Grubb (zoologist)|title=Ungulate Taxonomy|year=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0093-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] (4th century BC) was the first to [[species description|describe]] the species of ''Camelus''.

In 2007, Peng Cui of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and colleagues carried out a [[phylogenetic]] study of the evolutionary relationships between the two [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]] of Camelidae; [[Camelini]] – consisting of the three ''Camelus'' species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a [[subspecies]] of the Bactrian camel) – and [[Lamini]], which consists of the [[alpaca]] (''Vicugna pacos''), the [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), the [[llama]] (''L. glama'') and the [[vicuña]] (''V. vicugna''). The study showed the two tribes had [[genetic divergence|diverged]] 25 million years ago (early [[Miocene]]), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.

The dromedary and the Bactrian camel often interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Where the ranges of the species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the [[phenotypic]] differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties.&lt;ref name="camel"/&gt; However, a 1994 analysis of the [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome b]] [[gene]] showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their [[DNA sequencing|sequences]].&lt;ref name=stanley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=H.F.|last2=Kadwell|first2=M.|last3=Wheeler|first3=J.C.|title=Molecular evolution of the family Camelidae: a mitochondrial DNA study|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=1994|volume=256|issue=1345|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and hybrids==
{{main|Hybrid camel}}
The dromedary has 74 [[diploidy|diploid]] chromosomes, the same as other camelids.

==Evolution==
The extinct ''[[Protylopus]]'', which occurred in North America during the upper [[Eocene]], is the oldest and the smallest-known camel.&lt;ref name="mikesell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mikesell|first1=M.W.|title=Notes on the dispersal of the dromedary|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|date=1955|volume=11|issue=3|pages=231–45|jstor=3629022|doi=10.1086/soutjanth.11.3.3629022}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the transition from [[Pliocene]] to [[Pleistocene]], several mammals faced extinction.

The modern dromedary probably evolved in the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was closely related to the earliest Old World camels.&lt;ref name=payne/&gt; This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the dromedary [[foetus]] has two humps, while in the adult male an [[anterior]] [[vestigial organ|vestigial]] hump is present.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt; A jawbone of a dromedary that [[Radiocarbon dating#Calibration|dated]] from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name=nowak&gt;{{cite book|last=Nowak|first=R.M.|title=Walker's Mammals of the World|year=1999|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-5789-8|pages=1078–81|volume=2|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grigson|first=C.|last2=Gowlett|first2=J.A.J.|last3=Zarins|first3=J.|title=The camel in Arabia—a direct radiocarbon date, calibrated to about 7000 BC|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=1989|volume=16|issue=4|pages=355–62|doi=10.1016/0305-4403(89)90011-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Richard Bulliet]] of [[Columbia University]] wrote that the dromedary exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but did not have to depend upon its products.&lt;ref name=bulliet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bulliet|first1=R.W.|authorlink=Richard Bulliet|title=The Camel and the Wheel|date=1975|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York, USA|isbn=978-0-231-07235-9|pages=28–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and diseases===
[[File:Mers-virus-3D-image.jpg|thumbnail|right|3D image of MERS-CoV, of which the dromedary is possibly the animal source]]

The dromedary generally suffers from fewer diseases than  other domestic livestock such as goats and cattle.&lt;ref name=leupold&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leupold|first1=J.|title=Camel-an important domestic animal of the subtropics|journal=Blue Book for the Veterinary Profession|date=1968|volume=15|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature fluctuations occur throughout the day in a healthy dromedary – the temperature falls to its minimum at dawn, rises until sunset and falls during the night.&lt;ref name=leese1918&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leese|first1=A.S.|authorlink=Arnold Leese|title="Tips" on camels for veterinary surgeons on active service|date=1918|pages=1–56|url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/22454/1/SVAC3800.pdf|publisher=Bailliere, Tindall And Cox |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nervous camels may vomit if they are carelessly handled; this does not always indicate a disorder. Rutting males may develop nausea.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt;

The dromedary is prone to [[trypanosomiasis]], a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the [[tsetse fly]]. The main symptoms are recurring fever, [[anaemia]] and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel.&lt;ref name=currason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Currason|first1=G.|title=Le chameau et ses maladies|journal=Paris: Vigotfreres|date=1947|pages=188–237|trans-title=The camel and its diseases|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brucellosis]] is another prominent malady. In an observational study, the [[seroprevalence]] of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations. Brucellosis is caused by different [[biotype]]s of ''[[Brucella abortus]]'' and ''[[Brucella melitensis|B. melitensis]]''.&lt;ref name=brucella&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abbas|first=B.|last2=Agab|first2=H.|title=A review of camel brucellosis|journal=Preventive Veterinary Medicine|date=2002|volume=55|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1016/S0167-5877(02)00055-7|pmid=12324206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other internal parasites include ''[[Fasciola gigantica]]'' ([[trematode]]), two types of  [[cestode]] (tapeworm) and various [[nematode]]s (roundworms).

In 2013, a seroepidemiological study (a study investigating the patterns, causes and effects of a disease on a specific population on the basis of [[serologic]] tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the [[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus]] (MERS-CoV).&lt;ref name=merscov2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perera|first1=R.|last2=Wang|first2=P.|last3=Gomaa|first3=M.|last4=El-Shesheny|first4=R.|last5=Kandeil|first5=A.|last6=Bagato|first6=O.|last7=Siu|first7=L.|last8=Shehata|first8=M.|last9=Kayed|first9=A.|last10=Moatasim|first10=Y.|last11=Li|first11=M.|last12=Poon|first12=L.|last13=Guan|first13=Y.|last14=Webby|first14=R.|last15=Ali|first15=M.|last16=Peiris|first16=J.|last17=Kayali|first17=G.|title=Seroepidemiology for MERS coronavirus using microneutralisation and pseudoparticle virus neutralisation assays reveal a high prevalence of antibody in dromedary camels in Egypt, June 2013|journal=[[Eurosurveillance]]|date=2013|volume=18|issue=36|page=20574|doi=10.2807/1560-7917.ES2013.18.36.20574}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013–14 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus.

Fleas and ticks are common causes of physical irritation. In a study in Egypt, a species of ''[[Hyalomma]]'' was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in [[Arava Valley]] were injected with [[ivermectin]], which is not effective against ''Hyalomma'' tick infestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straten|first=M.|last2=Jongejan|first2=F.|title=Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) infesting the Arabian camel (''Camelus dromedarius'') in the Sinai, Egypt with a note on the acaricidal efficacy of ivermectin|journal=Experimental and Applied Acarology|date=1993|volume=17|issue=8|pages=605–16|doi=10.1007/BF00053490|pmid=7628237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larvae of the camel nasal fly ''[[Cephalopsis titillator]]'' can cause possibly fatal [[brain compression]] and [[Neurological disorder|nervous disorders]]. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are [[Pus|pyogenic]] diseases and wound infections caused by ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus]]'', [[pulmonary disease|pulmonary disorders]] caused by ''[[Pasteurella]]'' such as [[hemorrhagic septicemia]] and ''[[Rickettsia]]'' species, [[camelpox]], [[anthrax]], and [[cutaneous]] [[necrosis]] caused by ''[[Streptothrix]]'' and deficiency of salt in the diet.&lt;ref name=mammal/&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:DromedaryGroupIsrael052611.jpg|thumb|left|Herd of dromedaries in Israel]]
[[File:The American Museum journal (c1900-(1918)) (18160964071).jpg|thumb|right|The dromedary's relationships with the [[Barbary lion|lion]] and mankind is depicted in this [[taxidermy]] [[diorama]] by [[Jules Verreaux|Jules]] and [[Édouard Verreaux]], which is called "Lion Attacking a Dromedary," and was acquired by the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]], in 1898.&lt;ref name="ngNews" /&gt;]]

The dromedary is [[diurnality|diurnal]] (active mainly during daylight); free-ranging herds feed and roam throughout the day, though they rest during the hottest hours around noon. The night is mainly spent resting. Dromedaries form cohesive groups of about 20 individuals, which consist of several females led by a dominant male. Females may also lead in turns.&lt;ref name=mammal/&gt; Some males either form bachelor groups or roam alone.&lt;ref name=klingel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klingel|first1=H.|title=Social organization of the camel (''Camelus dromedarius'')|journal=Verhandlungen der Deutschen Zoologischen Gesellschaft|date=1985|volume=78|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herds may congregate to form associations of hundreds of camels during migrations at the time of natural disasters. The males of the herd prevent female members from interacting with bachelor males by standing or walking between them and sometimes driving the bachelor males away. In Australia, short-term [[home range]]s of feral dromedaries cover {{convert|50|to|150|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}; annual home ranges can spread over several thousand square kilometres.&lt;ref name=mammal/&gt;

Special behavioral features of the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, with the exception of rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring.&lt;ref name=mammal/&gt; Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed [[androgen]] levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs.&lt;ref name=yagil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yagil|first=R.|last2=Etzion|first2=Z.|title=Hormonal and behavioral patterns in the male camel (''Camelus dromedarius'')|journal=Reproduction|date=1 January 1980|volume=58|issue=1|pages=61–5|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0580061|pmid=7359491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors.

===Diet===
[[File:SFEC-2006-10-EGYPT-LUXOR-CAMEL0303.JPG|thumb|Dromedaries are primarily browsers]]

The dromedary's diet consists mostly of foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;mostly thorny plants.&lt;ref name=diet1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sambraus|first=H.H.|title=Biological function of morphologic peculiarities of the dromedary|journal=Tierarztliche Praxis|date=June 1994|volume=22|issue=3|pages=291–3|pmid=8048041}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%).&lt;ref name=field&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Field|first1=C.R.|title=Ecology and management of camels, sheep and goats in northern Kenya.

The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt;

In the Sahara, 332 plant species have been recorded as food plants of the dromedary. These include ''[[Aristida pungens]]'', ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'', ''[[Panicum turgidum]]'', ''[[Launaea arborescens]]'' and ''[[Balanites aegyptiaca]]''.&lt;ref name=gauthiers/&gt; The dromedary eats ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Atriplex]]'' and ''[[Salsola]]'' when they are available.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=D.M.R.|title=The feeds and feeding habits of Old and New World camels|journal=The Camelid|date=1979|volume=1|pages=250–92|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:277808/FULLTEXT01.pdf#page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer ''[[Trichodesma zeylanicum]]'' and ''[[Euphorbia tannensis]]''. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as ''[[Vigna aconitifolia]]'', ''[[Vigna mungo|V. mungo]]'', ''[[Cyamopsis tetragonolaba]]'', ''[[Melilotus parviflora]]'', ''[[Eruca sativa]]'', ''[[Trifolium]]'' species and ''[[Brassica campestris]]''.&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, [[Caudal (anatomical term)#Anterior and posterior|caudal]] opening of the [[foreskin|prepuce]] and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding.&lt;ref name=diet1/&gt; They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for an equal amount of time.&lt;ref name=mammal/&gt;

==Biology==
===Adaptations===
[[File:Dromedary Footprint in Sand.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Footprint in dry sand]]

The dromedary is specially adapted to its desert habitat; these adaptations are aimed at conserving water and regulating body temperature. The bushy eyebrows and the double row of eyelashes prevent sand and dust from entering the eyes during strong windstorms, and shield them from the sun's glare.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=S.A.|title=Animal Dreaming: The Spiritual and Symbolic Language of the Australasian Animals|date=2007|publisher=Blue Angel Gallery|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-9803983-0-4|pages=78–9|edition=Revised and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dromedary is able to close its nostrils voluntarily; this assists in water conservation.&lt;ref name="ngNews" /&gt; The dromedary can conserve water by reducing perspiration by fluctuating the body temperature throughout the day from {{convert|31|to|41.7|C|F}}. The kidneys are specialised to minimise water loss through excretion. Groups of camels avoid excess heat from the environment by pressing against each other. The dromedary can tolerate greater than 30% water loss, which is generally impossible for other mammals. In temperatures between {{convert|30|and|40|C|F}}, it needs water every 10 to 15 days. In the hottest temperatures the dromedary takes water every four to seven days. This camel has a quick rate of rehydration and can drink at {{convert|10|-|20|L|impgal|abbr=on}} per minute.&lt;ref name=mammal/&gt; The dromedary has a [[rete mirabile]], a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which uses countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain. This effectively controls the temperature of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zguigal|first1=H.|last2=Ghoshal|first2=N.G.|title=Gross and histologic study of the rostral epidural rete mirabile and the cavernous sinus in one-humped camels|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|date=1991|volume=52|issue=7|pages=1173–7|pmid=1892276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hump stores up to {{convert|80|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fat, which the camel can break down into water and energy to meet its needs when resources are scarce; the hump also helps dissipate body heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacFarlane|first1=W.V.|title=Survival in an arid land|journal=Australian Natural History|date=1977|volume=19|pages=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the hump is small, the animal can show signs of starvation. In a 2005 study, the mean volume of adipose tissues (in the external part of the hump that have cells to store lipids) is related to the dromedary's unique mechanism of food and water storage.&lt;ref name=adaptation&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Faye|editor1-first=B.|title=Desertification Combat and Food Safety: the Added Value of Camel Producers, Ashgabad, Turkmenistan|year=2005|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1-58603-473-3|pages=135–45|series=NATO Science Series (I): Life and Behavioural Sciences|volume=362|editor2-last=Esenov|editor2-first=P.|last1=Chilliard|first1=Y.|last2=Bengoumi|first2=M.|last3=Delavaud|first3=C.|last4=Faulconnier|first4=Y.|last5=Faye|first5=B.|chapter=Body lipids and adaptation of camel to food and water shortage: new data on adipocyte size and plasma leptin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of starvation, they can even eat fish and bones, and drink brackish and salty water.&lt;ref name=nowak/&gt; The hair is longer on the throat, hump and shoulders.

The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and depends on the individual, as does the reproductive period. Both sexes might [[sexual maturity|mature]] by three to five years of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdel Rahim|first1=S.E.|title=Studies on the age of puberty of male camels (''Camelus dromedarius'') in Saudi Arabia|journal=Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)|date=1997|volume=154|issue=1|pages=79–83|pmid=9265856|doi=10.1016/s1090-0233(05)80011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reproductive season, males splash their urine on their tails and nether regions.

The dromedary was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard, Suzanne |title=Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader |year=2003|publisher=Eisenbrauns |page=120 |isbn=9781575060835}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth or tenth century BC, the dromedary became popular in the Near East. The Persian invasion of Egypt under [[Cambyses]] in 525 BC introduced domesticated camels to the area. The Persian camels were not well-suited to trading or travel over the Sahara; journeys across the desert were made on chariots pulled by horses.&lt;ref name=bromiley&gt;{{cite book|last=Bromiley|first=G.

In 1840, about six camels were shipped from Tenerife to [[Adelaide]], but only one survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the explorer [[John Ainsworth Horrocks]]. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan Cameleers in Australia|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/afghan-cameleers|website=Australian Government|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite web|title=The Introduction of camels into Australia|url=http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Camels/Introducing_Camels_Into_Australia.htm|website=Burkes &amp; Wills Web (Digital Research Archive)|publisher=The Burke &amp; Wills Historical Society|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
The strength and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt; According to [[Richard Bulliet]], they can be used for a wide variety of purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather.&lt;ref name=bulliet/&gt; The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several [[Bedouin]] pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the [[Ruwallah]], the [[Bani Sakhr]] and the [[Mutayr]].&lt;ref name=sweet&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweet|first1=L.E.|title=Camel raiding of North Arabian Bedouin: a mechanism of ecological adaptation|journal=[[American Anthropologist]]|date=1965|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1132–50|doi=10.1525/aa.1965.67.5.02a00030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riding camels===

[[File:Camel in desert.JPG|thumb|A camel decorated for a tourist camel ride in the [[Judean Desert]]]]

Although the role of the camel is diminishing with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name=robertson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=J.|title=With the Cameliers in Palestine|date=1938|publisher=Naval &amp; Military Press|pages=35–44|location=Uckfield, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=camel/&gt; Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.&lt;ref name=leese/&gt;

The ideal riding camel is strong, slender and long-legged with thin, supple skin. The special adaptations of the dromedary's feet allow it to walk with ease on sandy and rough terrain and on cold surfaces.&lt;ref name=bligh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bligh|first1=J.|last2=Cloudsley-Thompson|first2=J.L.|last3=Macdonald|first3=A.G.|title=Environmental Physiology of Animals|publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-632-00416-4|pages=142–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camels of the [[Beja people|Bejas]] of Sudan&lt;ref name=epstein/&gt; and the Anafi camel bred in Sudan are common breeds used as riding camels.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt;

According to Leese, the dromedary walks with four speeds or gaits: walk, jog, fast run and canter. The first is the typical speed of walking, around {{convert|4|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Jog is the most common speed, nearly {{convert|8|-|12|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on level ground. He estimated a speed of {{convert|14|-|19|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} during a fast run, by observing northern African and Arabian dromedaries. He gave no speed range to describe the "canter", but implied it was a type of gallop that if induced could exhaust the camel and the rider. Canter could be used only for short periods of time, for example in races.&lt;ref name=gillespie&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillespie|first1=L.A.|title=Riding camels of the Sudan|journal=Sudan Journal of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry|date=1962|volume=3|issue=1|pages=37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal age to start training dromedaries for riding is three years,&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; although they may be stubborn and unruly.&lt;ref name=nanda&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nanda|first1=P.N.|title=Camel and their management|journal=[[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] Review Series|issue=16|date=1957|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting.&lt;ref name=leese/&gt; At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt; The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads before the age of six.&lt;ref name=leese/&gt; Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider.&lt;ref name=singh/&gt; Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian ''markloofa'' used by single riders and the Indian ''pakra'' used when two riders mount the same camel.&lt;ref name=leese/&gt;

===Baggage and draught camels===
The baggage camel should be robust and heavy. Studies have recommended the camel should have either a small or a large head with a narrow [[aquiline nose]], prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy.&lt;ref name=acland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acland|first1=P.B.E.|title=Notes on the camel in the eastern Sudan|journal=Sudan Notes and Records|date=1932|volume=15|issue=1|pages=119–49|jstor=41716025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage from the age of five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six.&lt;ref name=matharu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matharu|first1=B.S.|title=Camel care|journal=Indian Farming|date=1966|volume=16|pages=19–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hawia'' is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan.&lt;ref name=acland/&gt; The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt;

Draught camel are used for several purposes including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators.&lt;ref name=camel/&gt; It may be used for ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks.&lt;ref name=leese/&gt; The draught camel can plough at around {{convert|2.5|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and should not be used for more than six hours a day&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=nanda/&gt; The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.&lt;ref name=payne/&gt;

Camel milk is a staple food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it consists of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]], 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity ([[pH]] 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, [[niacin]] and [[vitamin C]] were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk.

The '''Russian domesticated red fox''' is a form of the wild [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') which has been [[Domestication|domesticated]] to an extent, under laboratory conditions. They are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of [[selective breeding]] to transform species, as described by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.{{r|Darwin (1859)}} The experiment was purposely designed to replicate the process that had produced [[dog]]s from [[Gray wolf|wolves]], by recording the changes in foxes, when in each generation only the most [[Taming|tame]] foxes were allowed to breed. In short order, the descendant foxes became tamer and more dog-like in their behavior.{{r|Trut (1999)}}{{r|Trut (2017)}}

The program was started in 1959 in the [[Soviet Union]] by zoologist [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]]{{r|Trut (1999)}} and it has been in continuous operation since. Today, the experiment is under the supervision of [[Lyudmila Trut]], in [[Russia]], at the [[Institute of Cytology and Genetics]] in [[Novosibirsk#Education|Novosibirsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/en/science/applied-research/domestication-of-foxes-and-problems-of-modern-animal-breeding.html|title=Domestication of foxes and problems of modern animal breeding|website=www.bionet.nsc.ru|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/domesticated-foxes-genetically-fascinating-terrible-pets/|title=Why domesticated foxes are genetically fascinating (and terrible pets)|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Trut (2017)}}

==Genetic experimentation==
===Initial premise and hypothesis===
The experiment was initiated by scientists who were interested in the topic of [[domestication]] and the process by which [[wolf|wolves]] became [[Origin of the domestic dog|domesticated dogs]]. They saw some [[retention of juvenile traits]] by adult dogs, both [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] ones, such as skulls that were unusually broad for their length, and [[behavior]]al ones, such as whining, barking, and submission.

In a time when centralized political control in the fields of genetics and agriculture promoted [[Lysenkoism]] as an official state doctrine, Belyayev's commitment to [[classical genetics]] had cost him his job as head of the Department of Fur Animal Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding in Moscow in 1948.{{r|Ratliff (2011)}} During the 1950s, he continued to conduct genetic research under the guise of studying animal physiology.

Belyayev believed that the key factor selected for in the domestication of dogs was not size or fertility, but behavior: specifically, tameability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/domesticated-foxes-genetically-fascinating-terrible-pets|title=Why domesticated foxes are genetically fascinating (and terrible pets)|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since behavior is rooted in [[biology]], selecting for tameness and against aggression means selecting for physiological changes in the systems that govern the body's [[hormone]]s and [[neurochemistry|neurochemicals]].

===Experimentation===
Belyayev decided to test his theory by domesticating foxes, in particular, the silver fox, a dark color mutation of the [[red fox]]. He placed a population of them under strong selection pressure for inherent tameness.{{r|Adams (2008)}} According to Trut: {{quote|The least domesticated foxes, those that flee from experimenters or bite when stroked or handled, are assigned to Class III. Foxes in Class II let themselves be petted and handled but show no emotionally friendly response to experimenters. Foxes in Class I are friendly toward experimenters, wagging their tails and whining. In the sixth generation bred for tameness we had to add an even higher-scoring category. Members of Class IE, the "domesticated elite", are eager to establish human contact, whimpering to attract attention and sniffing and licking experimenters like dogs. They start displaying this kind of behavior before they are one month old. By the tenth generation, 18 percent of fox pups were elite; by the 20th, the figure had reached 35 percent. Today elite foxes make up 70 to 80 percent of our experimentally selected population.{{r|Trut (1999)}}}}

Belyayev and Trut believed that selecting for tameness mimics the natural selection that must have occurred in the ancestral past of dogs, and, more than any other quality, must have determined how well an animal would adapt to life among humans.

===Results===
Russian scientists achieved a population of domesticated foxes that are fundamentally different in [[temperament]] and behavior from their wild forebears. Some important changes in [[physiology]] and morphology became visible, such as mottled or spotted colored fur. Some scientists {{citation needed|date=May 2017}} believe that these changes obtaining from selection for tameness are caused by lower [[adrenaline]] production in the new population, causing physiological changes within relatively few generations yielding genetic combinations not present in the original species. This indicates that selection for tameness, e.g. did not flee,  produces changes that are related to the emergence of other dog-like traits, e.g. raised tail, coming into [[oestrus|heat]] every six months rather than annually. These seemingly unrelated changes are a result of [[pleiotropy]].{{r|Darwin (1859)}}&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/sup&gt;

The project also bred the least-tameable foxes to study social behavior in canids. These foxes avoided human contact as do their wild behavioral phenotypes.{{r|Trut (2012)}}{{r|Trut (2017)}}

Similar research was carried out in Denmark with [[American mink]].{{r|Price (2008)}}

==Current project status==
Following the demise of the Soviet Union, the project ran into serious financial problems. In 2014, officials stated that the number of foxes was never reduced and is still stable at about 2,000.{{r|End}} {{as of|2016|August}}, there are 270 tame vixens and 70 tame males on the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160912-a-soviet-scientist-created-the-only-tame-foxes-in-the-world |title=A Soviet scientist created the only tame foxes in the world|work=BBBC Earth|date= 13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|Trut (2017)}}

In another published study, a system of measuring fox behavior was described that is expected to be useful in [[Quantitative trait locus|QTL mapping]] to explore the genetic basis of tame and aggressive behavior in foxes.{{r|Kukekova (2007)}}

The sculpture "Dmitriy Belyaev and the Domesticated Fox" was built near Institute of Cytology and Genetics (Novosibirsk) the honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Belyaev, Dmitry Konstantinovich|Dmitry Konstantinovich Belyaev]]. The tamed fox gives the scientist a paw and wags its tail. Konstantin Zinich, sculptor (Krasnoyarsk) says "The philosophy of touching a fox and a man is approchement, kindness, there is no aggression from the fox – it was wild, and he made it genetically domesticated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/index/press-czentr/pressa-o-nas/2017/08/09/v-novosibirske-otkryili-pamyatnik-uchenomu-s-dobroj-lisoj/ В Новосибирске открыли памятник ученому с доброй лисой]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''domestic yak''' (''Bos grunniens'') is a long-haired [[domestication|domesticated]] [[bovid]] found throughout the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and as far north as [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]]. It is descended from the [[wild yak]] (''Bos mutus'').&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Artiodactyla | id = 14200680 | page = 691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word "yak" is a loan originating from {{bo|t=གཡག་|w=g.yag}}. In Tibetan, it refers only to the male of the species, the female being called {{bo|t=འབྲི་|w='bri}}, or ''g.nag'' {{bo|t=གནག}}. In English, as in most other languages that have borrowed the word, "yak" is usually used for both sexes, with "bull" or "cow" referring to each sex separately.

==Taxonomy==
Yaks belong to the genus ''[[Bos]]'' and are therefore related to [[cattle]] (''Bos primigenius'' species). [[Mitochondrial DNA]] analyses to determine the evolutionary history of yaks have been inconclusive.

The yak may have diverged from cattle at any point between one and five million years ago, and there is some suggestion that it may be more closely related to [[bison]] than to the other members of its designated genus.&lt;ref name=Guo2006&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guo, S.| year = 2006 | title = Taxonomic placement and origin of yaks: implications from analyses of mtDNA D-loop fragment sequences |url=http://www.mammal.cn/EN/abstract/abstract2079.shtml| journal = Acta Theriologica Sinica | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 325–330|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparent close fossil relatives of the yak, such as ''Bos baikalensis'', have been found in eastern Russia, suggesting a possible route by which yak-like ancestors of the modern [[American bison]] could have entered the Americas.&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt;

The species was originally designated as ''Bos grunniens'' ("grunting ox") by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in 1766, but this name is now generally only considered to refer to the domesticated form of the animal, with ''Bos mutus'' ("mute ox") being the preferred name for the wild species. Although some authors still consider the wild yak to be a [[subspecies]], ''Bos grunniens mutus'', the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] made [[Opinion 2027|an official ruling]] in 2003&lt;ref name=iczn2027&gt;{{cite journal | author = International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature | year = 2003 | title = Opinion 2027.

P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except where the wild yak is considered as a subspecies of ''Bos grunniens'', there are no recognised subspecies of yak.

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Bos grunniens at Yundrok Yumtso Lake.jpg|left|thumb|A domestic yak at [[Yamdrok Lake]].]]
Yaks are heavily built animals with a bulky frame, sturdy legs, rounded cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur that hangs down lower than the belly. While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite variable in colour, often having patches of rusty brown and cream. They have small ears and a wide forehead, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour. In males (bulls), the horns sweep out from the sides of the head, and then curve forward.  They typically range from {{convert|48|to|99|cm|abbr=on}} in length. The horns of females (cows) are smaller, only {{convert|27|to|64|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and have a more upright shape. Both sexes have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the shoulders, although this is larger and more visible in males.&lt;ref name=Leslie2009&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Leslie, D.M. | author2 = Schaller, G.B. | year = 2009 | title = ''Bos grunniens'' and ''Bos mutus'' (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) | journal = Mammalian Species | volume = 836 | pages = 1–17 | doi = 10.1644/836.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Males weigh {{Convert|350|to|580|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, females weigh {{Convert|225|to|255|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Wild yaks can be substantially heavier, bulls reaching weights of up to {{convert|1000|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;Buchholtz, C. (1990). True Cattle (Genus ''Bos''). pp. 386–397 in S. Parker, ed.

(2003). ''Bos grunniens'' (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed 4 April 2009])&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the breed, domestic yak males are {{convert|111|-|138|cm|in}} high at the withers, while females are {{convert|105|-|117|cm|in}} high at the withers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/AD347E/ad347e06.htm|title=The Yak. Chapter 2: Yak breeds|website=FAO|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sexes have long shaggy hair with a dense woolly undercoat over the chest, flanks, and thighs to insulate them from the cold. Especially in bulls, this may form a long "skirt" that can reach the ground. The tail is long and horselike rather than tufted like the tails of cattle or bison. Domesticated yaks have a wide range of coat colours, with some individuals being white, grey, brown, roan or [[piebald]]. The [[udder]] in females and the [[scrotum]] in males are small and hairy, as protection against the cold. Females have four [[teat]]s.&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt;

Yaks grunt and, unlike cattle, are not known to produce the characteristic bovine lowing (mooing) sound, which inspired the scientific name of the domestic yak variant, ''Bos grunniens'' (grunting bull).  [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]] named the wild variant ''Bos mutus'' (silent bull), believing that it did not make a sound at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/AD347E/ad347e05.htm|title=ORIGINS, DOMESTICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF YAK|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further adaptations to the cold include a thick layer of [[subcutaneous fat]], and an almost complete lack of functional [[sweat glands]].&lt;ref name=Wiener/&gt;

Compared with domestic cattle, the [[rumen]] of yaks is unusually large, relative to the [[omasum]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This likely allows them to consume greater quantities of low-quality food at a time, and to ferment it longer so as to extract more nutrients.&lt;ref name=Wiener/&gt; Yak consume the equivalent of 1% of their body weight daily while cattle require 3% to maintain condition.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Odour==
Contrary to popular belief, yak and their manure have little to no detectable odour&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherpatrek.com/culture/yak-dung.php Yak Dung]. Sherpatrek.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; when maintained appropriately in pastures or paddocks with adequate access to forage and water. Yak's wool is naturally odour resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khunu.com/why-yak/superior-properties |title=Superior Properties of Yak Wool |accessdate=2012-05-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206105532/http://www.khunu.com/why-yak/superior-properties |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction and life history==
[[File:Yak calf in Austria 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Ten-day-old yak.]]
Yaks mate in the summer, typically between July and September, depending on the local environment. For the remainder of the year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like [[bison]], but unlike cattle, males wallow in dry soil during the rut, often while [[spraying (animal behavior)|scent-marking with urine]] or dung.&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt; Females enter [[oestrus]] up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.&lt;ref name=Sarkar2005&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Sarkar, M. | author2 = Prakash, B.S. | year = 2005 | title = Timing of ovulation in relation to onset of estrus and LH peak in yak (''Poephagus grunniens'' L.) | journal = Animal Reproduction Science | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 353–362 | doi = 10.1016/j.anireprosci.2004.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestation lasts between 257 and 270 days,&lt;ref name=Wiener/&gt; so that the young are born between May and June, and results in the birth of a single calf. The cow finds a secluded spot to give birth, but the calf is able to walk within about ten minutes of birth, and the pair soon rejoin the herd.&lt;ref name=Wiener/&gt; Females of both the wild and domestic forms typically give birth only once every other year,&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt; although more frequent births are possible if the food supply is good.

Calves are weaned at one year and become independent shortly thereafter. Wild calves are initially brown in colour, and only later develop the darker adult hair. Females generally give birth for the first time at three or four years of age,&lt;ref name=Zi2003&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zi, X.D. | year = 2003 | title = Reproduction in female yaks (''Bos grunniens'') and opportunities for improvement | journal = Theriogenology | volume = 59 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 1303–1312 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-691X(02)01172-X | pmid = 12527077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reach their peak reproductive fitness at around six years. Yaks may live for more than twenty years in domestication or captivity,&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt; although it is likely that this may be somewhat shorter in the wild.

==Hybrid yak==
In [[Nepal]], Tibet and Mongolia, domestic cattle are crossbred with yaks. This gives rise to the infertile male [[dzo]] མཛོ། as well as fertile females known as མཛོ་མོ།''dzomo'' or ''zhom'', which may be crossed again with cattle. The "Dwarf Lulu" breed, "the only ''Bos primigenius taurus'' type of cattle in Nepal" has been tested for DNA markers and found to be a mixture of both taurine and [[zebu]] types of cattle (''B. p. taurus'' and ''B. p. indicus'') with yak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Nepalese domestic dwarf cattle Lulu|journal=Animal Science Journal|author1=Takeda, K. |author2=Satoh, M. |author3=Neopane, S.P. |author4=Kuwar, B.S. |author5=Joshi, H.D. |author6=Shrestha, N.P. |author7=Fujise, H. |author8=Tasai, M. |author9=Tagami, T. |author10=Hanada, H. |doi=10.1111/j.1740-0929.2004.00163.x|year=2004|volume=75|issue=2|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Veterinary Information Service]], the low productivity of second generation cattle-yak crosses makes them suitable only as meat animals.&lt;ref name="ivis.org"/&gt;

Crosses between yaks and domestic cattle (''Bos primigenius taurus'') have been recorded in Chinese literature for at least 2,000 years.&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt;  Successful crosses have also been recorded between yak and [[American bison]],&lt;ref name="ivis.org"&gt;Zhang, R.C. (14 December 2000). [http://www.ivis.org/advances/Zhao/zhang3/IVIS.pdf "Interspecies Hybridization between Yak, ''Bos taurus'' and ''Bos indicus'' and Reproduction of the Hybrids"].

International Veterinary Information Service.&lt;/ref&gt; [[gaur]], and [[banteng]], generally with similar results to those produced with domestic cattle.&lt;ref name=Leslie2009/&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
Domesticated yaks have been kept for thousands of years, primarily for their milk, [[Yak fiber|fibre]] and meat, and as [[Working animal|beasts of burden]]. Their dried droppings are an important fuel, used all over Tibet, and are often the only fuel available on the high treeless Tibetan Plateau. Yaks transport goods across mountain passes for local farmers and traders as well as for climbing and trekking expeditions. "Only one thing makes it hard to use yaks for long journeys in barren regions. They will not eat grain, which could be carried on the journey.  They will starve unless they can be brought to a place where there is grass."&lt;ref&gt;Golden Book Encyclopedia, Vol. 16 p. 1505b. Rockefeller Center, NY: [[Golden Press]] (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; They also are used to draw [[plough]]s.&lt;ref name="bhutanyaks"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/jbs/pdf/JBS_02_01_04.pdf|title=Economy of Yak Herders|last=Gyamtsho|first=Pema|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yak's milk is often processed to a cheese called ''[[chhurpi]]'' in Tibetan and Nepali languages, and ''[[Mongolian cuisine|byaslag]]'' in Mongolia.

===Husbandry research===
The Indian government established a dedicated centre for research into yak husbandry, the ICAR-National Research Centre on Yak, in 1989. It is located at [[Dirang]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], and maintains a yak farm in the Nyukmadung area at an altitude of 2750 m above MSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAR-National Research Centre on Yak|url=http://nrcy.icar.gov.in/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yak sports===
In parts of Tibet and Karakorum, [[yak racing]] is a form of entertainment at traditional festivals and is considered an important part of their culture. More recently, sports involving domesticated yaks, such as [[yak skiing]] or [[yak polo]], are being marketed as tourist attractions in Central Asian countries, including in [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

{{about|the domesticated form of the European rabbit|the wild variety|European rabbit|all rabbit species|Rabbit}}

A '''domestic''' (or '''domesticated''') '''rabbit''' (''Oryctolagus''), more commonly known as a '''pet rabbit''', a '''bunny''', or a '''bunny rabbit''' is any of the [[Domestic animal|domesticated]] varieties of the [[European rabbit]] species. They may be considered a [[pocket pet]] depending on their size. A male rabbit is a ''buck,'' a female is a ''doe,'' and a young rabbit is a ''kit'' or ''kitten''. 

Rabbits were first exploited by the [[Romans]] as sources of [[Rabbit#As food and clothing|food and fur]], and have been kept as pets in Western nations since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Irving-PeaseFrantz2018"/&gt; Beginning in the 1980s, the idea of the domestic rabbit as a house companion, or '''house rabbit''', was promoted. Rabbits can be litter box trained and may come when called, but they need exercise and can damage a house that is not "rabbit proof". Especially following the Easter season, unwanted rabbits end up in [[Animal shelter|animal shelters]].&lt;ref name="NYT article1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lovett|first1=Ian|title=When Delight Turns to Reality, It’s Goodbye, Easter Bunny|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/us/when-delight-turns-to-reality-its-goodbye-easter-bunny.html|accessdate=18 February 2018|publisher=The New York Times|date=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they have become [[Rabbits in Australia|invasive in Australia]], pet rabbits are banned in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref name="QLD law article"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbit Laws in QLD: Real life threat|url=http://www.greencrossvet.com.au/Pet_Care_Information/Article-216/Rabbit-Laws-In-QLD.aspx|website=Greencross Vets|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Phoenicia]]n [[sailor]]s visiting the coast of [[Spain]] c. 12th century BC, mistaking the European rabbit for a species from their homeland (the [[rock hyrax]] ''Procavia capensis''), gave it the name ''i-shepan-ham'' (land or island of hyraxes).

The captivity of rabbits as a food source is recorded as early as the 1st century BC, when the Roman writer [[Pliny the Elder]] described the use of rabbit hutches, along with enclosures called ''{{ill|leporaria|fr|Leporarium}}''.&lt;ref name="Irving-PeaseFrantz2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irving-Pease|first1=Evan K.|last2=Frantz|first2=Laurent A.F.|last3=Sykes|first3=Naomi|last4=Callou|first4=Cécile|last5=Larson|first5=Greger|title=Rabbits and the Specious Origins of Domestication|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2018|issn=01695347|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2017.12.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A controversial theory is that a corruption of the rabbit's name used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] became the Latin name for the peninsula, ''[[Hispania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S1lDAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+System+of+Ancient+and+Medi%C3%A6val+Geography+for+the+Use+of+Schools+and+Colleges |last=Anthon |first=Charles |title=A System of Ancient and Mediæval Geography for the Use of Schools and Colleges |page=14}}{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, rabbits were raised in large walled colonies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the 19th century, as [[animal fancy]] in general began to emerge, rabbit fanciers began to sponsor rabbit exhibitions and fairs in [[Western Europe]] and the United States.  Breeds of various domesticated animals were created and modified for the added purpose of [[Show (animal)|exhibition]], a departure from the breeds that had been created solely for food, fur, or [[wool]]. The rabbit's emergence as a household pet began during the [[Victorian era]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The keeping of the rabbit as a pet commencing from the 1800s coincides with the first observable skeletal differences between the wild and domestic populations, even though captive rabbits had been exploited for over 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="Irving-PeaseFrantz2018"/&gt; Domestic rabbits have been popular in the United States since the late 19th century. What became known as the "Belgian Hare Boom" began with the importation of the first [[Belgian Hare]]s from England in 1888 and, soon after, the founding of the American Belgian Hare Association, the first rabbit club in America. From 1898 to 1901, many thousands of Belgian Hares were imported to America.&lt;ref name="TLC-BH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Rabbits - Belgian Hare|url=http://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/belgian-hare|website=The Livestock Conservancy|accessdate=21 February 2018|quote=Status: Threatened}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Belgian Hare is one of the rarest breeds, with only 132 specimens found in the United States in a 2015 census.&lt;ref name="AMBH survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hare Survey - Submitted by the Rare Breed Rabbits Group|url=http://belgianhareclub.com/hare_survey.html|website=American Belgian Hare Club|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Rabbit Breeders Association]] (ARBA) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds having a uniform Standard of Perfection, registration and judging system. The domestic rabbit continues to be popular as a [[animal show|show animal]] and pet.  Many thousand rabbit shows occur each year and are sanctioned in Canada and the United States by the ARBA. Today, the domesticated rabbit is the third most popular mammalian pet in Britain after dogs and cats. 

Rabbits have been, and continue to be, used in laboratory work such as the production of antibodies for vaccines and research of human male reproductive system toxicology. The Environmental Health Perspective, published by the [[National Institute of Health]], states, "The rabbit [is] an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of chemicals or other stimuli on the male reproductive system." According to the [[Humane Society]] of the United States, rabbits are also used extensively in the study of bronchial asthma, stroke prevention treatments, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer. [[Animal rights]] activists have opposed [[animal experimentation]] for non-medical purposes, such as the testing of cosmetic and cleaning products, which has resulted in decreased use of rabbits in these areas.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Terminology==
Male rabbits are called ''bucks''; females are called ''does''.  An older term for an adult rabbit is ''coney'', while ''rabbit'' once referred only to the young animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=coney Online Etymology Dictionary]{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another term for a young rabbit is ''bunny'', though this term is often applied informally (especially by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term ''kit'' or ''kitten'' has been used to refer to a young rabbit. A young [[hare]] is called a ''leveret''; this term is sometimes informally applied to a young rabbit as well.  A group of rabbits is known as a "colony" or a "nest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Collective Noun Page |url= http://www.ojohaven.com/collectives |access-date=January 30, 2008}}{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of rabbit genetics is of interest to fanciers, the fiber &amp; fur industry, medical researchers, and the [[meat industry]]. Among rabbit fanciers, the genetics of rabbit health and diversity are paramount. The fiber &amp; fur industry focuses on the genetics of coat color and hair properties. In the biomedical research community and the pharmaceutical industry, rabbit genetics are important in [[model organism]] research, antibody production, and toxicity testing. The meat industry relies on genetics for disease resistance, [[feed conversion ratio]]s, and reproduction potential in rabbits.

The rabbit genome has been sequenced and is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Genome of ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'' (rabbit) |work=NCBI.NLM.NIH.gov |publisher=[[United States National Institutes of Health]] |location=Washington, DC |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?term=oryctolagus%20cuniculus |access-date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mitochondrial DNA has also been sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gissi|first1=C. |last2=Gullberg|first2=A. |last3=Arnason|first3=U. |title=The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the rabbit, ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'' |journal=Genomics |volume=50 |date=1998 |issue=2 |pages=161–169 |doi=10.1006/geno.1998.5282 |pmid=9653643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, parts of the rabbit genome were re-sequenced in greater depth in order to expose [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|variation]] within the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carneiro |first=M |title=The Genetic Structure of Domestic Rabbits |url= http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/6/1801.full |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28 |date=2011 |issue=6 |pages=1801–1816 |access-date=19 February 2018 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msr003|pmc=3695642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 11 color [[gene]] groups (or loci) in rabbits. A rabbit's coat has either two [[pigment]]s (pheomelanin for yellow, and eumelanin for dark brown) or no pigment (for an [[albino]] rabbit).  Clusters of color genes plus their [[Modifications (genetics)|modifiers]] control such aspects as coat patterns (e.g. ''Dutch'' or ''English'' markings), color hues and their intensity or dilution, and the location of color bands on the hair shaft (e.g., silvering).

===Diet===
{{Main|Rabbit#Diet and eating habits}}
As a refinement of the diet of the wild rabbit, the diet of the domestic rabbit is often a function of its purpose. Show rabbits eat for vibrant health, strong musculoskeletal systems, and&amp;mdash;like rabbits intended for the fur trade&amp;mdash;optimal coat production and condition. Rabbits intended for the meat trade eat for swift and efficient production of flesh, while rabbits in research settings have closely controlled diets for specific goals. Nutritional needs of the domestic rabbit may also be focused on developing a physique that allows for the safe delivery of larger litters of healthy kits. Optimizing costs and producing feces that meet local waste regulations may also be factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://ojs.upv.es/index.php/wrs/article/view/382/369 |title=Towards reduced feeding costs, dietary safety and minimal mineral excretion in rabbits: A review |first=L. |last=Maertens |journal=World Rabbit Science |date=1999 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=65–74|access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet of a pet rabbit, too, is geared toward its purpose&amp;mdash;as a healthy and long-lived companion.

Hay is an essential part of the diet of all rabbits and it is a major component of the commercial [[Animal feed#Fodder|food pellets]] that are formulated for domestic rabbits and available in many areas. Pellets are typically fed to adult rabbits in limited quantities once or twice a day, to mimic their natural behavior and to prevent obesity.It is recommended only a teaspoon to a egg cup full of pellets is fed to adult rabbits each day. Most rabbit pellets are alfalfa-based for protein and fiber, with other grains completing the carbohydrate requirements. "muesli" style rabbit foods are also available, these contain separate components e.g. dried carrot, pea flakes and hay pellets as opposed to a uniform pellet. these are not recommended as rabbits will choose favored parts and leave the rest. muesli style feeds are often lower in fiber than pelleted versions of rabbit food, additionally numerous studies have found they increase the risk of obesity and dental disease.  Minerals and vitamins are added during production of rabbit pellets to meet the nutritional requirements of the domestic rabbit. Along with pellets, many commercial rabbit raisers also feed one or more types of loose [[hay]], for its freshness and important cellulose components. [[Alfalfa]] in particular is recommended for the growth needs of young rabbits.&lt;ref name="IndianaHRS food"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hay and Pellets: What do you feed a bunny? |work=IndianaHRS.org |publisher=House Rabbit Society, Indiana Chapter |url= http://www.indianahrs.org/rabbit-care/food-pellets-hay.aspx|access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digestion===
[[Rabbit#Diet and eating habits|Rabbits]] are [[Hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]] and therefore have an enlarged [[cecum]].  This allows a rabbit to digest, via [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], what it otherwise would not be able to metabolically process.

After a rabbit ingests food, the food travels down the esophagus and through a small valve called the [[cardia]].  In rabbits, this valve is very well pronounced and makes the rabbit incapable of vomiting.  The food enters the stomach after passing through the cardia. Food then moves to the stomach and small intestine where a majority of nutrient extraction and absorption takes place.  Food then passes into the colon and eventually into the cecum. [[Peristalsis|Peristaltic]] muscle contractions (waves of motion) help to separate fibrous and non-fibrous particles.  The non-fibrous particles are then moved backwards up the colon, through the illeo-cecal valve, and into the cecum. Symbiotic bacteria in the cecum help to further digest the non-fibrous particles into a more metabolically manageable substance.  After as little as three hours, a soft, fecal "pellet", called a [[cecotrope]], is expelled from the rabbit's anus.  The rabbit instinctively eats these grape-like pellets, without chewing, in exchange keeping the mucous coating intact. This coating protects the vitamin- and nutrient-rich bacteria from stomach acid, until it reaches the small intestine, where the nutrients from the [[cecotrope]] can be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Official Guidebook to Raising Better Rabbits and Cavies |location=Bloomington, Illinois |publisher=American Rabbit Breeders Association |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rees Davies|first1=R. |first2=J. A. E.|last2=Rees Davies |date=2003 |title=Rabbit Gastro-intestinal Physiology |journal=Vet. Clin. Exot. Anim. |volume=6 |pages=139–153 |url= http://www.medirabbit.com/EN/GI_diseases/Rees-Davies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soft pellets contain a sufficiently large portion of nutrients that are critical to the rabbit's health.  This soft fecal matter is rich in [[vitamin B]] and other nutrients.  The process of coprophagy is important to the stability of a rabbit's digestive health because it is one important way that which a rabbit receives vitamin B in a form that is useful to its digestive wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbit – Nutrition &amp; Management |date=April 19, 2011 |work=RabbitChow.com |publisher=[[Purina Mills]] |url= http://www.rabbitchow.com/NUTRITIONMANAGEMENT/default.aspx}}{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=This is an advertising site for a low-grade pet food company, not a reliable source for facts about rabbit biology.|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the rabbit may leave these pellets lying about its cage; this behavior is harmless and usually related to an ample food supply.

When caecal pellets are wet and runny (semi-liquid) and stick to the rabbit and surrounding objects they are called ontermittent soft cecotropes (ISCs). This is different from ordinary diarrhea and is usually caused by a diet too high in carbohydrates or too low in fiber. Soft fruit or salad items such as lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes are possible causes.

[[File:Domestic-rabbit-kanela-breastfeeding.ogv|thumb|right|Rabbit kits suckling from their mother|270px]]
Rabbits have a reputation as prolific breeders, and deservedly so, in part because rabbits reach breeding age quickly. To prevent unwanted offspring and to benefit the rabbit's health and behavior, rabbits may be [[Spaying|spayed]] or [[Neutering|neutered]] at sexual maturity: 4-5 months for small breeds (e.g., Mini Rex, Netherland Dwarf), 5-6 months for medium-sized breeds (e.g., Rex, New Zealand), and 6–7 months for large breeds (e.g., Flemish Giant). Bucks usually require more time to sexually mature than does, and they normally reach adult sperm counts at 6–7 months.

Rabbits, like all mammals, produce [[milk]] for their young.  Female rabbits have six to eight [[nipple]]s and produce milk for four weeks after birthing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rabbit Milk: A review of quantity, quality, and non-dietary affecting factors |first1=L.|last1=Maertens |first2=F.|last2=Labas |first3=Z.

Disease is rare when rabbits are raised in sanitary conditions and provided with adequate care.  Rabbits have fragile bones, especially in their [[Vertebral column|spine]]s, and need support on the belly or bottom when they are picked up.

Spayed or neutered rabbits kept indoors with proper care may have a lifespan of 8 to 12 years, with mixed-breed rabbits typically living longer than [[purebred]] specimens, and dwarf breeds having longer average lifespans than larger breeds.&lt;ref name="HRS lifespan" /&gt;  The world record for longest-lived rabbit is 18 years.&lt;ref name="HRS lifespan" /&gt;

===Vaccinations===
In most jurisdictions, including the United States (except where required by local [[animal control service|animal control]] ordinances), rabbits do not require [[vaccination]]. Vaccinations exist for both [[rabbit hemorrhagic disease]] and [[myxomatosis]].&lt;ref&gt;British Veterinary Association Rabbit Care Downloads http://www.link2content.co.uk/uploads/bva/rabbit.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These vaccinations are usually given annually, two weeks apart. If there is an outbreak of myxomatosis locally, this vaccine can be administered every six months for extra protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intervet.co.uk/binaries/92_114377.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225031231/http://www.intervet.co.uk/binaries/92_114377.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }} Intervet vaccination literature.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Myxomatosis immunizations are not available in all countries, including Australia, due to fears that immunity will pass on to feral rabbits. However, they are recommended by some veterinarians as [[Prophylaxis|prophylactics]], where they are legally available.&lt;ref name="Pavia 2003" /&gt;{{rp|182}}. In the UK a combined vaccination exists for myxomatosis and VHD1 made by Nobivac called Myxo-RHD, this is given yearly. Due to increasing cases of VHD2 it is now recommended rabbits receive an additional vaccination for RHD2 one brand for this is filovac, the vaccination is given yearly 2 weeks apart from other vaccinations, it may be given 6 monthly at rabbit believed to be at higher risk. 

===Declawing===
A rabbit cannot be [[Onychectomy|declawed]]. Lacking pads on the bottoms of its feet, a rabbit requires its claws for traction. Removing its claws would render it unable to stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbit.org/care/declawing.html|title=Why Rabbits Should Not Be Declawed|website=www.rabbit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbitwise.org/neverdo.html|title=Rabbit Care: Rabbit Never Do's|website=www.rabbitwise.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tonic immobility===
Coping with stress is a key aspect of rabbit behavior, and this can be traced to part of the brain known as [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA).  Dopaminergic neurons in this part of the brain release the hormone [[dopamine]], generalized as a "feel-good" hormone.  In humans, dopamine is released through a variety of acts, including sexual activity, [[substance abuse]], and even eating chocolate.  However, in rabbits, it is released as part of a coping mechanism while in a heightened state of fear or stress, and has a calming effect. Dopamine has also been found in the rabbit's [[medial prefrontal cortex]], the [[nucleus accumbens]], and the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guarraci|first1=F. |last2=Knapp|first2=B. |date=1999 |title=An electrophysiological characterization of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons during differential pavlovian fear conditioning in the awake rabbit |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=169–179 |publisher=|doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(98)00102-8 |PMID=10512583 |url= http://www.utdallas.edu/~tres/memory/emotional/kapp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological and behavioral responses to human-induced [[Apparent death#Tonic immobility|tonic immobility]] (TI, sometimes termed "trancing" or "playing dead") have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state, confirming that the promotion of TI to try to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners—thinking the rabbits enjoy it—is misplaced.&lt;ref name=VDWEtrancing2006/&gt; However, some researchers conclude that inducing TI in rabbits is appropriate for certain procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.&lt;ref name=VDWEtrancing2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBride |first1=Anne |last2=Day |first2=Simone |last3=McAdie |first3=Tina |last4=Meredith |first4=Anna |last5=Barley |first5=Jasmine |last6=Hickman |first6=Janice |last7=Lawes |first7=Lesley |date=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |volume= |issue= |pages=135–137 |location=Sint-Niklaas, Belgium |publisher=Vlaamse Dierenartsenvereniging (VDV) |doi= |url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/11361/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712123331/http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/11361/ |archivedate=July 12, 2016 |deadurl=no }} HopperHome [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf PDF] [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124225101/http://hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf archived] November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sore hocks===
The formation of [[Ulcer (dermatology)|open sores]] on the rabbit's [[Hock (zoology)|hocks]], commonly called "sore hocks", is a problem that commonly afflicts mostly heavy-weight rabbits kept in cages with wire flooring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Housing |work=Rabbit.org |publisher=House Rabbit Society |url= http://rabbit.org/faq-housing/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or soiled solid flooring.  The problem is most prevalent in rex-furred rabbits and heavy-weight rabbits (9+ pounds in weight), as well as those with thin foot bristles.

The condition results when, over the course of time, the protective bristle-like fur on the rabbit's hocks thins down. Standing urine or other unsanitary cage conditions can exacerbate the problem by irritating the sensitive skin. The exposed skin in turn can result in tender areas or, in severe cases, open sores, which may then become infected and abscessed if not properly cared for.

===Gastrointestinal stasis===
[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals Gut of a rabbit.jpg|thumb|right|Digestive system of the rabbit, &lt;i&gt;by Ruth Lawson, Otago Polytechnic 26 November 2007&lt;/i&gt;|400px]]
Gastrointestinal [[stasis (medicine)|stasis]] (GI stasis) is a serious and potentially fatal condition that occurs in some rabbits in which [[gut motility]] is severely reduced and possibly completely stopped. When untreated or improperly treated, GI stasis can be fatal in as little as 24 hours.

GI stasis is the condition of food not moving through the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] as quickly as normal. The gut contents may [[dehydration|dehydrate]] and compact into a hard, immobile mass (impacted gut), blocking the [[digestive tract]] of the rabbit. Food in an immobile gut may also [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|ferment]], causing significant [[gas]] buildup and resultant gas pain for the rabbit.

The first noticeable symptom of GI stasis may be that the rabbit suddenly stops eating. Treatment frequently includes intravenous or subcutaneous [[fluid therapy]] ([[Fluid replacement|rehydration]] through [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] of a balanced electrolyte solution), pain control, possible careful massage to promote gas expulsion and comfort, drugs to promote gut motility, and careful monitoring of all inputs and outputs. The rabbit's diet may also be changed as part of treatment, to include force-feeding to ensure adequate nutrition.  Surgery to remove the blockage is not generally recommended and comes with a poor prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harkness |first=John E. |title=Biology and Medicine of Rabbits and Rodents |edition=5th |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Ames, Iowa |isbn=978-0-8138-1531-2 |pages=306–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rabbits are more prone to GI stasis than others. The causes of GI stasis are not completely understood, but common contributing factors are thought to include stress, reduced food intake, low fiber in the diet, dehydration, reduction in exercise or blockage caused by excess fur or carpet ingestion.  Stress factors can include changes in housing, transportation, or medical procedures under anesthesia. As many of these factors may occur together (poor dental structure leading to decreased food intake, followed by a stressful veterinary dental procedure to correct the dental problem) establishing a root cause may be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Jeffery |chapter=Gastrointestinal Diseases |title=Ferrets, Rabbits and Rodents: Clinical Medicine and Surgery |editor1-last=Hillyer|editor1-first=E. V. |editor2-last=Quesenberry|editor2-first=K. |date=1997 |publisher=W.B. Saunders Co. |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-7216-4023-5 |pages=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GI stasis is sometimes misdiagnosed as "hair balls" by veterinarians or rabbit keepers not familiar with the condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rabbit.org/journal/3-7/gi.html House Rabbit Society: Sluggish Motility in the Gastrointestinal Tract]{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.html University of Miami Department of Biology: Gastrointestinal Stasis, The Silent Killer]{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fur is commonly found in the stomach following a fatal case of GI stasis, it is also found in healthy rabbits.  Molting and chewing fur can be a predisposing factor in the occurrence of GI stasis, however, the primary cause is the change in motility of the gut.

===Dental problems===
[[Dental disease]] has several causes, namely [[genetics]], inappropriate [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], injury to the [[jaw]], [[infection]], or [[cancer]].

[[File:Bradygnathia-superior-rabbit.jpg|right|thumb|Malocclusion in a rabbit]]
* [[Malocclusion]]: Rabbit teeth are open-rooted and continue to grow throughout their lives. In some rabbits, the teeth are not properly aligned, a condition called ''malocclusion''. Because of the misaligned nature of the rabbit's teeth, there is no normal wear to control the length to which the teeth grow. There are three main [http://www.rabbit.org/journal/2-6/tusks.html causes of malocclusion], most commonly genetic [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]], injury, or [[bacterial infection]]. In the case of [[congenital]] malocclusion, treatment usually involves veterinary visits in which the teeth are treated with a dental [[burr (cutter)|burr]] (a procedure called [[crown (tooth)|crown]] reduction or, more commonly, teeth clipping) or, in some cases, permanently removed.  In cases of simple [[malocclusion]], a block of wood for the rabbit to chew on can rectify this problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* [[Molar (tooth)|Molar]] spurs: These are spurs that can dig into the rabbit's [[tongue]] and/or [[cheek]] causing pain. These should be filed down by an experienced exotic veterinarian specialised in rabbit care, using a dental burr, for example.
* [[Osteoporosis]]: Rabbits, especially neutered females and those that are kept indoors without adequate natural sunlight, can suffer from osteoporosis, in which holes appear in the skull by X-Ray imaging. This reflects the general thinning of the bone, and teeth will start to become looser in the sockets, making it uncomfortable and painful for the animal to chew hay. The inability to properly chew hay can result in molar spurs, as described above, and weight loss, leading into a downward spiral if not treated promptly. This can be reversible and treatable. A veterinary formulated liquid [[calcium]] supplement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vetark.co.uk/pages/Zolcal-D-liquid-calcium.aspx|title=Zolcal D liquid calcium|website=www.vetark.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[vitamin D3]] and [[magnesium]] can be given mixed with the rabbit's drinking water, once or twice per week, according to the veterinarian's instructions. The molar spurs should also be trimmed down by an experienced exotic veterinarian specialised in rabbit care, once per 1-2 months depending on the case.

Signs of dental difficulty include difficulty eating, [[weight loss]] and small [[Feces|stool]]s and visibly overgrown teeth. However, there are many other causes of [[ptyalism]], including pain due to other causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medirabbit.com/EN/Dental_diseases/Differential/generalities_ptyalism.htm|title=Differential diagnosis for ptyalism|website=www.medirabbit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiratory and conjunctival problems===
An over-[[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] ailment amongst rabbits is [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] [[infection]], known colloquially as "snuffles". ''[[Pasteurella]]'', a [[bacterium]], is usually misdiagnosed and this is known to be a factor in the overuse of [[antibiotic]]s among rabbits.&lt;ref name="respiratory"&gt;Respiratory Disease by Susan A. Brown&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=This is not enough information to identify and verify the source.}} A runny nose, for instance, can have several causes, among those being high [[temperature]] or [[humidity]], extreme [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[environmental pollution]] (like perfume or incense), or a [[sinus infection]]. Options for treating this is removing the pollutant, lowering or raising the temperature accordingly, and medical treatment for sinus infections.&lt;ref name="respiratory" /&gt; ''Pasteurella'' does live naturally in a rabbit's [[respiratory tract]], and it can flourish out of control in some cases. In the rare event that happens, antibiotic treatment is necessary.

[[Sneeze|Sneezing]] can be a sign of environmental pollution (such as too much [[dust]]) or a [[food allergy]].

Runny eyes and other [[conjunctiva]]l problems can be caused by [[dental disease]] or a blockage of the [[tear duct]]. Environmental pollution, [[cornea]]l disease, [[entropion]], [[distichiasis]], or [[inflammation]] of the eyes are also causes. This is easy to diagnose as well as treat.&lt;ref name="respiratory" /&gt;

===Viral diseases===
Rabbits are subject to infection by a variety of [[viruses]]. Some have had deadly and widespread impact.

In Australia, rabbits caged outdoors in areas with high numbers of [[mosquitoes]] are vulnerable to myxomatosis. In Europe, [[flea]]s are the carriers of myxomatosis. In some countries, annual [[vaccination]]s against myxomatosis are available.

====Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD)====
{{Main|Rabbit haemorrhagic disease}}
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as ''viral hemorrhagic disease'' (VHD) or ''rabbit calicivirus disease'' (RCD),&lt;ref name="CFSPH-IICAB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease: Viral Hemorrhagic Disease of Rabbits, Rabbit Calicivirus Disease |date=September 2007 |author=Center for Food Security &amp; Public Health |author2=Institute for International Cooperation in Animal Biologics |work=CFSPH.IAState.edu |publisher=Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine |url= http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf |access-date=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is caused by a rabbit-specific [[Caliciviridae|calicivirus]] known as RHDV or RCV. Discovered in 1983, RHD is highly infectious and usually fatal. Initial signs of the disease may be limited to fever and lethargy, until significant internal organ damage results in labored breathing, squealing, bloody mucus, and eventual coma and death. Internally, the infection causes necrosis of the liver and damages other organs, especially the spleen, kidneys, and small intestine.

RHD, like myxomatosis, has been intentionally introduced to control feral rabbit populations in Australia and (illegally) in New Zealand, and RHD has, in some areas, escaped [[quarantine]]. The disease has killed tens of millions of rabbits in China (unintentionally) as well as Australia, with other [[epidemics]] reported in Bolivia, Mexico, South Korea, and continental Europe. Rabbit populations in New Zealand have bounced back after developing a genetic immunity to RHD, and the disease has, so far, had no effect on the genetically divergent native wild rabbits and hares in the Americas.&lt;!--See main article on the disease for more sources, and copy them over as needed.--&gt;

Thus far, outbreaks have been controlled quickly through quarantine, depopulation, disease tracing, and cleaning and disinfection; however, rabbit losses have been in the thousands. An RHD vaccine exists, but it is not recommended for use where the disease is not widespread in wildlife, as it may hide signs of disease and is not considered a practical response for such a rapidly spreading disease.}}

In the UK, reports of RHD (as recently as February 2018) have been submitted to the [[British Rabbit Council]]'s online "Notice Board".&lt;ref name="BRC Notice Board"&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice Board|url=http://www.thebrc.org/nb/notice.php|website=The British Rabbit Council|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccines for RHD are available&amp;mdash;and mandatory&amp;mdash;in the UK.

{{anchor|Wry neck|reason=That is an old section title. (Changed to "Wry neck &amp; parasitic fungus" 18 February 2018.)}}
[[Wry neck]] (or ''head tilt'') is a condition in rabbits that can be fatal, due to the resulting [[disorientation]] that causes the animal to stop eating and drinking.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Inner ear infection]]s or [[ear mite]]s, as well as diseases or injuries affecting the brain (including [[stroke]]) can lead to wry neck. The most common cause, however, is a parasitic microscopic fungus called ''[[Encephalitozoon cuniculi]]'' (''E.&amp;nbsp;cuniculi''). Note that: "despite approximately half of all pet rabbits carrying the infection, only a small proportion of these cases ever show any illness".&lt;ref name="RWAF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbits and E. cuniculi (Encephalatizoon cuniculi)|url=https://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/rabbit-health/e-cuniculi/|website=Rabbit Welfare Association &amp; Fund|accessdate=18 February 2018|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vets now recommend treating rabbits{{clarify|date=February 2018|reason=do you mean PROACTIVELY treating them?}} against ''E.&amp;nbsp;cuniculi''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The usual drugs for treatment and prevention are the [[benzimidazole]] [[anthelmintics]], particularly [[fenbendazole]] (also used as a deworming agent in other animal species). In the UK, fenbendazole (under the brand name ''[[Panacur]] Rabbit''), is sold [[over-the-counter]] in oral paste form as a nine-day treatment. Fenbendazole is particularly recommended for rabbits kept in colonies and as a preventive before mixing new rabbits with each other.&lt;ref name="RWAF" /&gt;

===Fly strike===
[[Myiasis|Fly strike]], or blowfly strike, (''Lucilia sericata'') is a condition that occurs when flies (particularly [[botfly|botflies]]) lay their eggs in a rabbit's damp or soiled fur, or in an open wound. Within 12 hours, the eggs hatch into the larval stage of the fly, known as [[maggots]].  Initially small but quickly growing to {{convert|15|mm|in}} long, maggots can burrow into skin and feed on an animal's tissue, leading to [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] and death. The most susceptible rabbits are those in unsanitary conditions, sedentary ones, and those unable to clean their excretory areas. Rabbits with diarrhea should be inspected for fly strike, especially during the summer months.&lt;ref name="HRS-Fly strike"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harriman|first1=Marinell|title=Fly Strike|url=https://rabbit.org/journal/2-12/fly-strike.html|website=House Rabbit Society|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topical treatment Rearguard&amp;reg; (from Novartis) is approved in the United Kingdom for 10-week-per-application prevention of fly strike.&lt;ref name="Rearguard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of [Rearguard] Product Characteristics (AN. 01134/2015)|url=http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/productinformationdatabase/SPC_Documents/SPC_101976.DOC|website=Veterinary Medicines Directorate|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom (gov.uk)|accessdate=21 February 2018|format=MS Word document|date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most genetic defects in the domestic rabbit (such as dental problems in the Holland Lop breed) are due to recessive genes.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Genetics are carefully tracked by fanciers who [[Animal show#competition|show]] rabbits, to breed out defects.

Rabbits have been kept as [[Pet|pets]] in [[Western world|Western nations]] since the 19th century, but because of the [[Rabbits in Australia|destructive history]] of feral rabbits in Australia, domestic rabbits are illegal as pets in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref name="QLD law article"/&gt; Depending upon its size, a rabbit may be considered a type of [[pocket pet]]. Rabbits can bond with humans,&lt;ref name="HRS-Bonding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramnaraine|first1=Amy|title=Bonding With Your Rabbit|url=https://rabbit.org/bonding-with-your-rabbit/|website=House Rabbit Society|accessdate=21 March 2018|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; can learn to follow simple voice commands and to come when called,&lt;ref name="Pavia 2003" /&gt;{{rp|166}} and are curious and playful.

Rabbits are especially popular as pets in the United States during the [[Easter]] season, due to their association with the holiday. However, [[animal shelter]]s that accept rabbits often complain that during the weeks and months following Easter, there is a rise in unwanted and neglected rabbits that were bought as Easter "gifts", especially for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Easter Rabbits |date=April 4, 2007 |work=ABC7 News |publisher=[[WLS-TV]] |location=Chicago |url= http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=websites&amp;id=5182955 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202043356/http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources&amp;id=5182955 |archive-date=February 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar problems arise in rural areas after [[county fair]]s and the like, in jurisdictions where rabbits are legal prizes in [[Carnival game|fairground games]].

Thus, there are many [[humane society|humane societies]], [[animal shelter]]s, and [[rescue group]]s that have rabbits available for [[pet adoption]]. [[Animal fancy|Fancy]] rabbit breeds are often purchased from pet stores, private breeders, and fanciers.

===House rabbits===

[[File:Openlitterbox.JPG|thumb|Two house rabbits in their litter box]]
Keeping a rabbit as a house companion was popularised by Sandy Crook in her 1981 book ''Your French Lop''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1983, at the American Family Pet Show in [[Anaheim, California]] (attended by 35,000), Crook presented her personal experiences living with an indoor rabbit as evidence of a human-rabbit bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crook |first=Sandy |title=Lop Rabbits as Pets |publisher=T.F.H. Publications |date=1986 |page=8}}{{primary source inline|date=October 2015|reason=Crook is not a reliable source for how big her own audience was.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, it became more common to litter box train a rabbit and keep it indoors, after{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=Harriman's own book cannot be used to source the idea that it was influential.}} the publication of Marinell Harriman's ''House Rabbit Handbook: How to Live with an Urban Rabbit'' in 1985. (The book's fifth edition was published in 2013.)&lt;ref name="HRH"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harriman|first1=Marinell|title=House Rabbit Handbook: How to Live with an Urban Rabbit|date=2013|publisher=Drollery Press|isbn=978-0940920187|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the domestic descendants of wild [[Prey animal|prey animals]], rabbits are alert, timid creatures that startle fairly easily, and many of their behaviors are triggered by the [[fight-or-flight response]] to perceived threats. According to the House Rabbit Society, the owner of a pet rabbit can use various behavioral approaches to gain the animal's trust and reduce aggression, though this can be a long and difficult process.&lt;ref name="HRS-Aggression" /&gt;

In addition, there is evidence to suggest that young rabbits that occupy the periphery of the "[[Litter (animal)|litter]] huddle" obtain less milk from the mother and, as a result, have a lower weight. It has been suggested that this factor may contribute to behavioural differences in litter mates during [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reyes-Meza|first=Veronica|last2=Hudson|first2=Robyn|last3=Martínez-Gómez|first3=Margarita|last4=Nicolás|first4=Leticia|last5=Rödel|first5=Heiko G.|last6=Bautista|first6=Amando|date=2011-10-24|title=Possible contribution of position in the litter huddle to long-term differences in behavioral style in the domestic rabbit|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938411003714|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=104|issue=5|pages=778–785|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.07.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Care ===
Not all Veterinarians will treat rabbits, and pet owners may have to seek out an [[Exotic animal veterinarian|Exotic Animal Veterinarian]] for their rabbit's care. Rabbits need regular checkups at the veterinarian because they may hide signs of illness or disease. Additionally, rabbits need regular maintenance in the form of being able to chew on something and having their nails trimmed regularly. A technique known as a "bunny burrito" (or less alliteratively a "rabbit burrito")  {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} helps a pet person manage a rabbit by surrounding it with a towel so that the animal cannot leap away, scratch with its front or back feet, or reach around and bite the person handling it. The name comes from the fact that the bunny looks like the filling of a burrito (with the towel acting as the tortilla).

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
The advantages of keeping rabbits as pets is that they are quiet, clean, smart, cute, and soft. They may react favorably to handling and petting depending on their personality and how they were raised. There are also many different sizes and characteristics available to a pet owner owing to a long history of breeding. Rabbits are friendly to each other and are often compatible with other pets. Rabbits are herbivores and their diet is relatively simple. Compared to other small animals, rabbits are robust creatures with strong hind legs (they can run fast) and powerful teeth. Rabbits should never be picked up by the “scruff” on the back of their neck, since "their skeletons are light compared to their bodies, and susceptible to trauma from falling, twisting, and kicking".&lt;ref name="HRS-UE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Meara|first1=Holly|title=An Uplifting Experience|journal=House Rabbit Journal (Fall 1998)|date=10 February 2013|volume=3|issue=11|url=https://rabbit.org/an-uplifting-experience/|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disadvantages of keeping rabbits as pets is that they may chew many things in the house. Male rabbits may mark their territory with a strong-smelling urine. Rabbits can bite under certain circumstances and they can also scratch. They can injure someone with their hind legs and rear claws if they jump out of someone's arms quickly. They have to be picked up and handled properly. They may leave feces around the house. Many rabbits may not be that friendly or interested in human beings. Male rabbits can be aggressive and territorial. Rabbits may not want to be touched. They will also make a high pitched scream when they are hurt or scared.

==As livestock==

{{anchor|Commercial rabbits|reason=Old section title.}}

{{See also|Cuniculture}}
Rabbits have been kept as [[livestock]] since ancient times for their meat, wool, and fur. In modern times, rabbits are also utilized in scientific research as [[Animal testing|laboratory animals]].

===Meat rabbits===
[[Image:Farmrabbits.jpg|thumb|right|Meat-breed rabbits were a supplementary food source during the [[Great Depression]]]]

Breeds such as the [[List of rabbit breeds#New Zealand rabbit|New Zealand]] and [[List of rabbit breeds#Californian|Californian]] are frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries.  These breeds have efficient [[metabolism]]s and grow quickly; they are ready for [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] by approximately 14 to 16 weeks of age.

Rabbit fryers are rabbits that are between 70 and 90 days of age, and weighing between 3 and 5&amp;nbsp;lb (1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kg) live weight. Rabbit roasters are rabbits from 90 days to 6 months of age weighing between 5 and 8&amp;nbsp;lb (2 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg) live weight. Rabbit stewers are rabbits from 6 months on weighing over 8&amp;nbsp;lb.

Any type of rabbit can be slaughtered for meat, but those exhibiting the "commercial" body type are most commonly raised for meat purposes. Dark fryers (any other color but albino whites) are sometimes lower in price than albino fryers because of the slightly darker tinge of the fryer (purely pink carcasses are preferred by consumers) and because the dark hairs are easier to see than if there are residual white hairs on the carcass.  There is no difference in skinability.

===Wool rabbits===
Rabbits such as the [[Angora rabbit|Angora]], [[American Fuzzy Lop]], and [[Jersey Wooly]] produce [[wool]]. However, since the American Fuzzy Lop and Jersey Wooly are both dwarf breeds, only the much larger Angora breeds such as the English Angora, Satin Angora, Giant Angora, and French Angoras are used for commercial wool production.  Their long fur is sheared, [[comb]]ed, or [[Pluck (hair removal)|plucked]] (gently pulling loose hairs from the body during [[molt]]ing) and then spun into [[yarn]] used to make a variety of products. Angora [[sweater]]s can be purchased in many clothing stores and is generally mixed with other types of wool.  Rabbit wool, called Angora, is 2.5 times warmer than sheep's wool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierratradingpost.com/lp2/wool-guide/] {{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rabbit Pelt Peddler MET DP817837.jpg|thumb|left|''Peaux de Lapin'' ("Rabbit skins") ''by Edme Bouchardon (1737)'']]

===Fur rabbits===
Rabbit breeds that were developed for their fur qualities include the [[Rex rabbit|Rex]] with its plush texture, the [[Satin (rabbit)|Satin]] with its lustrous color, and the [[Chinchilla rabbit|Chinchilla]] for its exotic pattern. White rabbit fur may be dyed in an array of colors that aren't produced naturally. Rabbits in the fur industry are fed a diet focused for robust coat production and pelts are harvested after the rabbit reaches prime condition, which takes longer than in the meat industry. Rabbit fur is used in local and commercial textile industries throughout the world. China imports much of its rabbit fur from Scandinavia (80%) and some from North America (5%), according to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service GAIN Report CH7607.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Laboratory rabbits===
Rabbits have been and continue to be used in [[laboratory]] work such as production of [[antibodies]] for [[vaccine]]s and research of human [[male reproductive system]] [[toxicology]]. In 1972, around 450,000 rabbits were used for experiments in the United States, decreasing to around 240,000 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A review of trends in animal use in the United States (1972–2006) |last1=Kulpa-Eddy|first1=Jodie |last2=Snyder|first2=Margaret |last3=Stokes|first3=William |journal=AATEX |issue=14, Special Issue: Proceedings of the 6th World Congress on Alternatives &amp; Animal Use in the Life Sciences, August 21–25, 2007 |date=2008 |publisher=Japanese Society for Alternatives to Animal Experiments |pages=163–165 |url= http://www.soc.nii.ac.jp/jsaae/zasshi/WC6_PC/paper163.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313093813/http://www.soc.nii.ac.jp/jsaae/zasshi/WC6_PC/paper163.pdf |archive-date=March 13, 2012 |access-date=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Health Perspective, published by the [[National Institute of Health]], states, "The rabbit [is] an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of [[chemical]]s or other [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] on the male reproductive system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morton |first=Daniel |title=The use of rabbits in male reproductive toxicology |date=April 1988 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=77 |pages=5–9 |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |doi=10.2307/3430622 |pmc=1474531 |pmid=3383822 |jstor=3430622}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Humane Society]] of the United States, rabbits are also used extensively in the study of bronchial [[asthma]], [[stroke]] [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] [[therapy|treatment]]s, [[cystic fibrosis]], [[diabetes]], and [[cancer]].

The [[New Zealand rabbit|New Zealand White]] is one of the most commonly used breeds for research and testing.
[[File:Rabbits at Polyface Farm.jpg|thumb|Pasture-raised rabbits in a moveable enclosure at [[Polyface Farm]]]]

[[Animal rights]] activists generally oppose [[animal experimentation]] for all purposes, and rabbits are no exception.{{Synthesis inline|date=July 2010}} The use of rabbits for the [[Draize test]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Draize Eye Test and ''in vitro'' alternatives:A left-handed marriage? |first=M.

===Housing===
{{anchor|Outdoor housing|reason=Old section name.}}
Rabbits can live outdoors in properly constructed, sheltered [[Hutch (animal cage)|hutches]], which provide protection from the elements in winter and keep rabbits cool in summer heat.  To protect from predators, rabbit hutches are usually situated in a fenced yard, [[shed]], [[barn]], or other enclosed [[structure]], which may also contain a larger [[Pen (enclosure)|pen]] for exercise.&lt;ref name="IndianaHRS housing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianahrs.org/rabbit-care/housing.aspx|title=Rabbit Housing Options|work=IndianaHRS.org|publisher=House Rabbit Society, Indiana Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rabbits in such an environment can alternatively be allowed to roam the secured area freely, and simply be provided with an adapted [[doghouse]] for shelter.  A more elaborate setup is an [[Warren (domestic)|artificial warren]].

==Exhibition==

===Conformation shows===
[[File:Oryctolagus cuniculus01 Cat Show.JPG|thumb|left|Judging at a rabbit show|205px]]
Show rabbits are an increasingly popular activity. Showing rabbits helps to improve the vigor and physical behavior of each breed through competitive selection. [[County fair]]s are common venues through which rabbits are shown in the United States and many other countries. Rabbit [[Club (organization)|club]]s at local to national levels hold many shows each year. On any given weekend one may be able to find a show in most regions of the United States and the United Kingdom. Although only purebred animals are shown, a [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigree]] is not required to enter a rabbit in show sanctioned by the American Rabbit Breeders Association show but is required to register a rabbit with the ARBA.; a rabbit must be registered in order to receive a Grand Champion certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Official Show Rules |date=2009 |publisher=American Rabbit Breeders Association}}{{full citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=Not enough details are provided to identify and locate this source; needs at least one of URL, ISBN, ISSN, DOI.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Závody králíků Praha 2014.JPG|thumb|right|Rabbit show jumping]]
Children's clubs such as [[4-H]] also include rabbit shows, usually in conjunction with [[county fair]]s. The ARBA holds an annual national convention which has as many as 25,000 animals competing for form all over the world. The national show moves to a different city each year. The ARBA also sponsors youth programs for families as well as underprivileged rural and inner-city children to learn responsible care and breeding of domestic rabbits.

===Show jumping===
{{Main article|Rabbit show jumping}}
Rabbit show jumping, a form of [[Animals in sport|animal sport]] between rabbits, began in the 1970s and has since become popular in [[Europe]], particularly [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Any rabbit, regardless of breed, may participate in this kind of competition, as it is based on athletic skill.

[[File:Tourterelle rieuse MHNT.jpg|thumb| Egg of ''Streptopelia risoria'' – [[Muséum de Toulouse]]]]

The '''Barbary dove''', '''ringed turtle dove''', '''ringneck dove''', '''ring-necked turtle dove''', or '''ring dove''' (''Streptopelia risoria'') is a domestic member of the [[dove]] [[family (biology)|family]] (Columbidae).

Although the Barbary dove is normally assigned its own systematic name, as ''Streptopelia risoria'', considerable doubt exists as to its appropriate classification. Some sources confidently assert that it is a domestic form of the [[Eurasian collared dove]], ''S. decaocto'', but the majority of evidence points to it being a domesticated form of the [[African collared dove]], ''S. roseogrisea''. It appears that it can [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] freely with either species, and its status as a species must therefore be regarded as doubtful. However, because of the wide use of both the common and systematic names, it is best to consider it separately from either of the putative parent species. Their time of domestication is also uncertain. While Linnaeus described them in 1756, they may have been imported into Italy from North Africa in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fisher, James | year=1953 | title=British Birds, number 5, Vol. XLVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbary doves are easily kept and long-lived in captivity, living for up to 12 years. However, there have been cases of doves living over 20 years,&lt;ref&gt;''Documented Info by a hobbyist at [http://diamonddove.info/bird11%20Ringneck.htm]''&lt;/ref&gt; and, in one case, of a dove living for 29 years&lt;ref&gt;.''Documented story at [http://diamonddove.info/bird11%20Ringneck.htm]''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years they have been used extensively in biological research, particularly into the hormonal bases of [[reproduction|reproductive behaviour]], because their sequences of courtship, mating and parental behaviour have been accurately described and are highly consistent in form. Dove fanciers have bred them in a great variety of colours; the number of colours available has increased dramatically in the latter half of the twentieth century, and it is thought that this has been achieved by interbreeding with ''S. roseogrisea''. Some of these doves carry a mutation that makes them completely white. These white Barbaries are most commonly used in [[stage magic]] acts.  White Barbary doves are traditionally released in large public ceremonies, since it is a [[peace symbol]] in several cultures, and "dove releases" are also sometimes found at weddings and funerals. However, a [[release dove]] is, in fact, usually a [[homing pigeon]], as Barbary doves lack the homing instinct and will die left out in the wild.

The ''coo'' of the Barbary dove is created by [[muscle]]s that vibrate air sent up from the dove's [[lung]]s.  These muscles belong to the fastest known class of [[vertebrate]] muscles, contracting as much as ten times faster than muscles vertebrates use for running.  This class of muscles is usually found in high speed tissue such as a [[rattlesnake|rattlesnake's]] tail. Barbary doves are the first bird species to have been found to have this class of muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Elemans CP, Spierts IL, Muller UK, Van Leeuwen JL, Goller F | title=Bird song: superfast muscles control dove's trill | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=431 | issue=7005 | year=2004 | pages=146 | doi=10.1038/431146a | pmid=15356620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feral]] populations of Barbary doves establish themselves readily as a result of escapes or releases from captivity, but they will merge with local populations of Eurasian collared doves if they exist.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The '''domestic pigeon''' (''Columba livia domestica'') is a [[Columbidae|pigeon]] [[subspecies]] that was derived from the [[rock dove]] (also called the [[rock pigeon]]). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest [[domesticated]] bird. [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do [[Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyph]]ics.&lt;ref name="Blechman"&gt;{{cite book| last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird. | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007| location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://andrewblechman.com/pigeons/learn_more.html| isbn =978-0-7022-3641-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Blechman" /&gt;

Pigeons have made contributions of considerable importance to humanity, especially in times of war.&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In war the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. So-called [[war pigeon]]s have carried many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. Medals such as the [[Croix de guerre]], awarded to [[Cher Ami]], and the [[Dickin Medal]] awarded to the pigeons [[G.I. Joe (pigeon)|G.I. Joe]] and [[Paddy (pigeon)|Paddy]], amongst 32 others, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.

==Reproduction==
Domestic pigeons reproduce in a similar way to the wild [[rock pigeon#Reproduction|rock pigeon]]. Generally humans will select breeding partners. [[Crop milk]] or [[pigeon milk]] produced by both male and female parent birds may occasionally be replaced with [[Crop milk#Hand-rearing pigeon chicks|artificial substitutes]]. Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process. Baby pigeons are called ''squeakers'' or ''squabs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gorman | first =Kate | title =Bird lady of Haslet helps to elevate occasions | publisher =Star Telegram (Jun 15, 2008) | url =http://www.star-telegram.com/407/story/700926.html | accessdate =2008-06-25 }}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained domestic pigeons are able to return to the home loft if released at a location that they have never visited before and that may be up to [[1 E6 m|1000 km]] away. A special breed, called [[homing pigeon]]s has been developed through selective breeding to carry messages and members of this variety of pigeon are still being used in the sport of [[pigeon racing]] and the [[release dove|white release dove]] ceremony at weddings and funerals.

The ability a pigeon has to return home from a strange location necessitates two sorts of information. The first, called "map sense" is their geographic location. The second, "compass sense" is the bearing they need to fly from their new location in order to reach their home. Both of these senses, however, respond to a number of different cues in different situations. The most popular conception of how pigeons are able to do this is that they are able to sense the [[Earth's magnetic field]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des Sciences de St. Pétersbourg, VI, Ser. Tome|volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier|first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal= Revne Philosophique de la France et de l'Étranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Magnetic Orientation in Birds | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 29–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with tiny magnetic tissues in their head ([[magnetoception]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. This is all the more surprising as they are not a [[bird migration|migratory]] species, which is a fact used by some ornithologists to dispute this theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Another theory is that pigeons have compass sense, which uses the position of the sun, along with an internal clock, to work out direction. However, studies have shown that if magnetic disruption or clock changes disrupt these senses, the pigeon can still manage to get home. The variability in the effects of manipulations to these sense of the pigeons indicates that there is more than one cue on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = Avian navigation: from historical to modern concepts | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 257–272 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other purposes of pigeon breeding==

===For food===
{{Main|Squab}}
Pigeons are also bred for meat, generally called squab and harvested from young birds. Pigeons grow to a very large size in the nest before they are [[fledge]]d and able to fly, and in this stage of their development (when they are called squabs) they are prized as food. For commercial meat production a breed of large white pigeon, named "[[King (pigeon)|King pigeon]]," has been developed by selective breeding. Breeds of pigeons developed for their meat are collectively known as [[utility pigeons]].

===Exhibition breeds===
{{Main|Fancy pigeon}}
[[Pigeon keeping|Pigeon fanciers]] developed many exotic forms of pigeon. These are generally classed as [[fancy pigeon]]s. Fanciers compete against each other at exhibitions or shows and the different forms or [[breed]]s are judged to a [[Breed standard|standard]] to decide who has the best bird. Among those breeds are the [[English carrier pigeon]]s, a variety of pigeon with [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] and a unique, almost vertical, stance ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071210183002/http://members.aol.com/duiven/highlight/carrier/carrier.htm pictures]). There are many ornamental breeds of pigeons, including the "Duchess" breed, which has as a prominent characteristic feet that are completely covered by a sort of fan of feathers. The [[fantail pigeon]]s are also very ornamental with their fan-shaped tail feathers.

===Flying/Sporting===
[[File:Domestic Pigeon Flock.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic pigeons in flight]]
{{Main|Flying/Sporting pigeons}}
Pigeons are also kept by enthusiasts for the enjoyment of [[Flying/Sporting pigeons|Flying/Sporting]] competitions. Breeds such as [[tippler]]s are flown in endurance contests by their owners.

==Experimentation==
Domestic pigeons are also commonly used in laboratory experiments in biology, medicine and [[cognitive science]].

===Cognitive science===
Pigeons have been trained to distinguish between [[cubism|cubist]] and [[impressionism|impressionist]] paintings, for instance. In Project Sea Hunt, a US coast guard search and rescue project in the 1970s/1980s, pigeons were shown to be more effective than humans in spotting shipwreck victims at sea.&lt;ref name=uscg&gt;{{cite web

Pigeons are able to acquire orthographic processing skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Damian Scarf|author2=Karoline Boy|author3=Anelisie Uber Reinert|author4=Jack Devine|author5=Onur Güntürkün|author6=Michael Colombo|title=Orthographic processing in pigeons (Columba livia)|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2016|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/13/1607870113.full|access-date=24 September 2016|doi=10.1073/pnas.1607870113|pmc=5056114}}&lt;/ref&gt; which form part of the ability to read, and basic numerical skills equivalent to those shown in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Damian Scarf|author2=Harlene Hayne|author3=Michael Colombo|title=Pigeons on par with primates in numerical competence|journal=Science|date=2016|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6063/1664|access-date=24 September 2016|doi=10.1126/science.1213357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegal predator killing by enthusiasts==
In the [[United States]], some pigeon keepers illegally trap and kill [[hawk]]s and [[falcon]]s to protect their pigeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | last =Milstein

 | accessdate =2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon by the majority of fanciers. None of the major clubs condone this practice. It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and that 1,000–2,000 are killed in southern [[California]] annually. In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] for killing birds of prey. Seven Californians and a [[Texas|Texan]] were also charged in the case.

In the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region of the [[United Kingdom]] pigeon fanciers have been blamed for a trap campaign to kill [[peregrine falcon]]s. Eight illegal spring-loaded traps were found close to peregrine nests and at least one of the protected birds died. The steel traps are thought to have been set as part of a "concerted campaign" to kill as many of the birds as possible in the West Midlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith | first =Lewis | title =Pigeon fanciers blamed for trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons | publisher =Times Online  | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4029413.ece | format =Online news  | accessdate =2008-06-20  | location=London | date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pigeon related illness==
[[File:Chicago pigeon in flight 2.jpg|thumb|Chicago-native ''Columba livia domestica'' in flight.]]
Pigeon breeders sometimes suffer from an ailment known as ''[[bird fancier's lung]]'' or ''pigeon lung''. A form of [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], ''pigeon lung'' is caused by the inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can sometimes be combated by wearing a filtered mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other pigeon related pathogens causing lung disease are ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'' (which causes [[psittacosis]], ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'' (which causes [[histoplasmosis]] and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', which causes [[cryptococcosis]].

==Feral pigeons==
{{Main|Feral pigeon}}
[[File:WinterPigeons02.jpg|right|thumb|Feral rock pigeons commonly show a very wide range of plumage variation.]]

Many domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the [[feral]] pigeon. These show a variety of plumages, although some look very much like pure rock pigeons. The scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds. Domestic pigeons can often be distinguished from feral pigeons because they usually have a metal or plastic band around one (sometimes both) legs which shows, by a number on it, that they are registered to an owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Porter | first =Cynthya | title =Goodview man finds racing pigeon | publisher =Winona Post | url =http://www.winonapost.com/stock/functions/VDG_Pub/detail.php?choice=25710&amp;home_page=1&amp;archives= | accessdate =2008-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''camel''' is an [[even-toed ungulate]] in the genus ''Camelus'' that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels have long been domesticated and, as [[livestock]], they provide food ([[camel milk|milk]] and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from [[camel hair|hair]]). As [[working animal]]s, camels&amp;mdash;which are uniquely suited to their desert habitats&amp;mdash;are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo. There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped [[dromedary]] makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped [[Bactrian camel]] makes up the remainder. The [[Wild Bactrian camel]] is a separate species and is now [[critically endangered]].

The word ''camel'' is derived via {{lang-la|camelus}} and {{lang-grc-gre|κάμηλος}} (''kamēlos'') from Hebrew or Phoenician: ''gāmāl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=2nd|title=camel|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Herper | first = Douglas | title = camel | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camel | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927090522/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camel | archivedate = 27 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Used informally, "camel" (or, more correctly, "camelid") refers to any of the seven members of the family Camelidae: the dromedary, the Bactrian, and the wild Bactrian (the true camels), plus the [[llama]], the [[alpaca]], the [[guanaco]], and the [[vicuña]]&lt;ref name=bornstein10&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1751-0147-52-S1-S17 | issn = 1751-0147 | volume = 52 | issue = Suppl 1 | page = S17 | last = Bornstein | first = Set | title = Important ectoparasites of Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) | journal = Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.actavetscand.com/content/52/S1/S17 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130605081655/http://www.actavetscand.com/content/52/S1/S17 | archivedate = 5 June 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the "New World" camelids).

The camel [[immune system]] differs from those of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped [[antibody]] molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in addition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait that makes them smaller and more durable. These "heavy-chain-only" antibodies, discovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koenig |first1=R. |title=VETERINARY MEDICINE: 'Camelized' Antibodies Make Waves |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5855 |page=1373 |year=2007 |pmid=18048665 |doi=10.1126/science.318.5855.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like horses before their extinction in their continent of origin, camels spread across the [[Bering land bridge]], moving in the opposite direction from the Asian immigration to America. They survived in the Old World, and eventually humans domesticated them and spread them globally. Along with many other megafauna in North America, the original wild camels were wiped out during the spread of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] from Asia into North America, 12,000 to 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=worboys10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=macphee99 /&gt;

Martin Heide's 2010 work on the domestication of the camel tentatively concludes that humans had domesticated the Bactrian camel by at least the middle of the third millennium somewhere east of the [[Zagros Mountains]], with the practice then moving into Mesopotamia. Heide suggests that mentions of camels "in the patriarchal narratives may refer, at least in some places, to the Bactrian camel", while noting that the camel is not mentioned{{by whom|date=June 2018}} in relationship to [[Canaan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heide | first1 = Martin | year = 2011 | title = The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible | url = | journal = Ugarit-Forschungen | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 367–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] by Lidar Sapir-Hen and Erez Ben-Yosef discovered what may be the earliest domestic camel bones yet found in Israel or even outside the [[Arabian Peninsula]], dating to around 930 BC.

The historian [[Richard Bulliet]] did not think that the occasional mention of camels in the Bible meant that the domestic camels were common in the Holy Land at that time.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|last= Dias|first= Elizabeth|title= The Mystery of the Bible's Phantom Camels|url= http://world.time.com/2014/02/11/the-mystery-of-the-bibles-phantom-camels/|accessdate= 22 February 2014|newspaper= Time|date =Feb 11, 2014|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140215013057/http://world.time.com/2014/02/11/the-mystery-of-the-bibles-phantom-camels/|archivedate= 15 February 2014|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist [[William F. Albright]], writing even earlier, saw camels in the Bible as an [[anachronism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heide | first1 = Martin | year = 2011 | title = The Domestication of the Camel: Biological, Archaeological and Inscriptional Evidence from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel and Arabia, and Literary Evidence from the Hebrew Bible | url = | journal = Ugarit-Forschungen | volume = 42 | issue = | page = 368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official report by Sapir-Hen and Ben-Joseph notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;The introduction of the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) as a pack animal to the [[southern Levant]] ... substantially facilitated trade across the vast deserts of Arabia, promoting both economic and social change (e.g., Kohler 1984; Borowski 1998: 112–116; Jasmin 2005). This ... has generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern Levant (and beyond) (e.g., Albright 1949: 207; Epstein 1971: 558–584; Bulliet 1975; Zarins 1989; Köhler-Rollefson 1993; Uerpmann and Uerpmann 2002; Jasmin 2005; 2006; Heide 2010; Rosen and Saidel 2010; Grigson 2012). Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack animal sometime in the early [[Iron Age]] (not before the 12th century [BC])&lt;/blockquote&gt; and concludes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Current data from copper smelting sites of the [[Arabah|Aravah Valley]] enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]]. The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century [BC] and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region—attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I]]—raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.&lt;ref name="Sapir-Hen 2013 277–285"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Desert tribes and Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents, [[yurt]]s, clothing, bedding and accessories. Camels have outer guard hairs and soft inner down, and the fibers are sorted{{by whom|date=June 2018}} by color and age of the animal. The guard hairs can be felted for use as waterproof coats for the herdsmen, while the softer hair is used for premium goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9384e/v9384e05.htm|title= Harvesting of textile animal fibres|last= Petrie|first= OJ|work= FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin No. 122|publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|date= 1995|ISBN= 92-5-103759-0|accessdate= 14 March 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170315085646/http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9384e/v9384e05.htm|archivedate= 15 March 2017|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or crochet.

By at least 1200 BC the first camel saddles had appeared, and [[Bactrian camels]] could be ridden. The first saddle was positioned to the back of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500 and 100 BC, Bactrian camels came into military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC the military Arabian saddle evolved, which again improved the saddle design slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last= Fagan|editor-first= Brian M|editor-link = Brian M.

When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The two armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses, seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off; and so it came to pass that all Croesus's hopes withered away. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121201230133/http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.html | archivedate = 1 December 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historygroup-nz"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | title = Cameliers and camels at war | work = New Zealand History online | accessdate = 5 December 2012 | date = 30 August 2009 | url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/67k0AH48W?url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps | archivedate = 18 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camels are the ultimate pillars that support national economies of many developing countries, because they are useful for transport, and provide food in the form of meat and milk (Tariq ''et al.'',2010).&lt;ref&gt;Tariq, M., Rabia, R., Jamil, A., Sakhwat, A., Aadil, A., &amp; Muhammad S., 2010.

===Religion===

====Islam====
Camel meat is ''[[halal]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـلَال}}, 'allowed') for [[Islam|Muslims]]. However, according to some [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools of thought]], a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it. Consequently, these schools hold that Muslims must perform ''[[wudhu]]'' (ablution) before the next time they [[Salat|pray]] after eating camel meat.&lt;ref name="purification"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/001.sat.html#001.0184|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716145540/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/001.sat.html#001.0184|archivedate=16 July 2011|series=Partial Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 1|work=Purification (Kitab Al-Taharah)|title=Book 1, Number 0184|publisher= Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|quote=Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib: The Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was asked about performing ablution after eating the flesh of the camel. He replied: Perform ablution, after eating it. He was asked about performing ablution after eating meat. He replied: Do not perform ablution after eating it. He was asked about saying prayer in places where the camels lie down. He replied: Do not offer prayer in places where the camels lie down. These are the places of Satan. He was asked about saying prayer in the sheepfolds. He replied: You may offer prayer in such places; these are the places of blessing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some Islamic schools of thought consider it ''[[haram]]'' ({{lang-ar|حَـرَام}}, 'forbidden') for a Muslim to perform ''[[Salat]]'' in places where camels lie, as it is said to be a dwelling place of the ''[[Devil (Islam)|Shaytan]]'' ({{lang-ar|شَـيْـطَـان}}, '[[Devil]]').&lt;ref name="purification"/&gt; According to [[Abu Yusuf]], the urine of camel may be used for medical treatment if necessary, but according to [[Abū Ḥanīfa]]h, the drinking of camel urine is discouraged.&lt;ref name="alden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=John Alden|title=The Word of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAj-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=25 October 2016|year=1994|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79076-6|page=98|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408182755/https://books.google.com/books?id=rAj-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic texts contain several stories featuring camels. In the story of the people of [[Thamud]], the Prophet [[Salih]] miraculously brings forth a ''[[She-Camel of God|naqat]]'' ({{lang-ar|نَـاقَـة}}, 'she-camel') out of a rock. After the Prophet [[Muhammad]] [[Hegira|migrated]] from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]], he allowed [[Qaswa|his she-camel]] to roam there; the location where the camel stopped to rest determined the location where he would build his house in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Campo, Juan Eduardo (2009). ''Encyclopedia of Islam''. [[Infobase Publishing]]. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes species which are semi-domesticated, undomesticated but [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] on a commercial scale, or commonly wild-caught, at least occasionally captive-bred, and [[Tame animal|tameable]]. In order to be considered fully domesticated, most species have undergone significant [[Heredity|genetic]], [[Behavior|behavioural]] and/or [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes from their wild ancestors; while others have been changed very little from their wild ancestors despite hundreds or thousands of years of potential [[selective breeding]]. A number of factors determine how quickly any changes may occur in a species, however, there isn't always a desire to improve a species from its wild form. Domestication is a gradual process, i.e., there is no precise moment in the history of a given species when it can be considered to have become fully domesticated.

[[Archaeozoology]] has identified three classes of animal domesticates: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, guinea pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., cows, sheep, pig, goats); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, camel, donkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/659964 |title=The Origins of Agriculture: New Data, New Ideas |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=52 |pages=S163–S174 |year=2011 |last1=Price |first1=T. Douglas |last2=Bar-Yosef |first2=Ofer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semidomesticated, routinely captive-bred, or domestication status unclear ==
Due to the somewhat unclear outlines of what, precisely, constitutes [[domestication]], there are some species that may or may not be fully domesticated. There are also species that are extensively used or kept as pets by humans, but are not significantly altered from wild-type animals. Most animals on this second table are at least somewhat altered from wild animals by their extensive interactions with humans. Many could not be released into the wild, or are in some way dependent on humans.

The '''domestic turkey''' (''[[Meleagris gallopavo]]'') is a large [[fowl]], one of the two [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Meleagris]]'' and the same as the [[wild turkey]]. Although turkey domestication was thought to have occurred in central Mesoamerica at least 2,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-08/uof-urd080812.php|title=UF researchers discover earliest use of Mexican turkeys by ancient Maya|date=August 8, 2012|work=EurekAlert!}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent research suggests a possible second domestication event in the Southwestern United States between 200 BC and AD 500.  However, all of the main domestic turkey varieties today descend from the turkey raised in central Mexico that was subsequently imported into Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Speller"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Speller, C.

Domestic turkey is a popular form of poultry, and it is raised throughout temperate parts of the world, partially because industrialized farming has made it very cheap for the amount of meat it produces. Female domestic turkeys are referred to as ''hens'', and the chicks may be called [[wikt:poult|''poults'']] or [[wikt:turkeyling|''turkeylings'']]. In the United States, the males are referred to as ''toms'', while in the United Kingdom and Ireland, males are ''stags''.

The great majority of domestic turkeys are bred to have white feathers because their [[pin feathers]] are less visible when the carcass is dressed, although brown or bronze-feathered varieties are also raised. The fleshy protuberance atop the beak is the [[Snood (anatomy)|snood]], and the one attached to the underside of the beak is known as a [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]].

The [[Turkey (bird)#History and naming|English language name for this species]] results from an early misidentification of the bird with an unrelated species which was imported to Europe through the country of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OL60E3r2yiYC&amp;pg=PA1217 ''Webster's II New College Dictionary'']. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-618-39601-6}}, p. 1217&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin species name {{wikt-lang|la|gallopāvō}} means "chicken peacock".

==History==
[[File:Turkey Whistle LACMA M.86.296.172.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Ceramic whistle in the shape of a turkey. [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|Colima shaft tomb culture]], 200 B.C. – A.D. 500]]
The modern domestic turkey is descended from one of six [[subspecies]] of [[wild turkey]]: ''[[Meleagris gallopavo]]'', found in the area bounded by the present Mexican states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Veracruz]]&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=2199 ''Wild turkey: Meleagris gallopavo'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

Domestic turkeys were taken to Europe by the Spanish. Many distinct breeds were developed in Europe (e.g. [[Black (turkey)|Spanish Black]], [[Royal Palm (turkey)|Royal Palm]]). In the early 20th century, many advances were made in the [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] of turkeys, resulting in breeds such as the [[Beltsville Small White]].

Prior to the late 19th century, turkey was something of a luxury in the UK, with [[goose]] or [[beef]] a more common [[Christmas dinner]] among the working classes.&lt;ref name=VCT&gt;[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/VictorianChristmas.htm A Victorian Christmas] ''Historic UK.com'' Retrieved December 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843), [[Bob Cratchit]] had a goose before [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]] bought him a turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens (1843) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MlMHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=scrooge+sent+a+turkey&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vNAXTaaWPMq1hAfZv5i3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Christmas carol in prose, being a ghost story of Christmas] p.156. Bradbury &amp; Evans&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey production in the UK was centered in [[East Anglia]], using two breeds, the [[Norfolk Black]] and the Norfolk [[Bronze (turkey)|Bronze]] (also known as Cambridge Bronze). These would be driven as flocks, after shoeing, down to markets in London from the 17th century onwards - the breeds having arrived in the early 16th century via Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.turkeyclub.org.uk/ | title = The Turkey Club UK | accessdate = December 21, 2007 | date = March 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intensive farming]] of turkeys from the late 1940s dramatically cut the price, making it more affordable for the working classes. With the availability of refrigeration, whole turkeys could be shipped frozen to distant markets. Later advances in disease control increased production even more. Advances in shipping, changing consumer preferences and the proliferation of commercial poultry plants has made fresh turkey inexpensive as well as readily available.

Recent genome analysis has provided researchers with the opportunity to determine the evolutionary history of domestic turkeys, and their relationship to other domestic fowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Behaviour==
[[File:Anatomy of turkey head.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Anatomical structures on the head and throat of a domestic turkey. 1. Caruncles, 2. Snood, 3. Wattle (Dewlap), 4. Major caruncle, 5. Beard]]
Young domestic turkeys readily fly short distances, perch and roost.  These behaviours become less frequent as the birds mature, but adults will readily climb on objects such as bales of straw. Young birds perform spontaneous, frivolous running ('frolicking') which has all the appearance of play. Commercial turkeys show a wide diversity of behaviours including 'comfort' behaviours such as wing-flapping, feather ruffling, leg stretching and dust-bathing. Turkeys are highly social and become very distressed when isolated.  Many of their behaviours are socially facilitated i.e. expression of a behaviour by one animal increases the tendency for this behaviour to be performed by others. Adults can recognise 'strangers' and placing any alien turkey into an established group will almost certainly result in that individual being attacked, sometimes fatally. Turkeys are highly vocal, and 'social tension' within the group can be monitored by the birds’ vocalisations. A high-pitched trill indicates the birds are becoming aggressive which can develop into intense sparring where opponents leap at each other with the large, sharp [[talons]], and try to peck or grasp the head of each other.  Aggression increases in frequency and severity as the birds mature.
[[File:Turkeybird.JPG|thumb|Male domestic turkey sexually displaying by showing the snood hanging over the beak, the caruncles hanging from the throat, and the 'beard' of small, black, stiff feathers on the chest]]
Maturing males spend a considerable proportion of their time sexually displaying.  This is very similar to that of the wild turkey and involves fanning the tail feathers, drooping the wings and erecting all body feathers, including the 'beard' (a tuft of black, modified hair-like feathers on the centre of the breast). The skin of the head, neck and [[caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]] (fleshy nodules) becomes bright blue and red, and the snood (an erectile appendage on the forehead) elongates, the birds 'sneeze' at regular intervals, followed by a rapid vibration of their tail feathers. Throughout, the birds strut slowly about, with the neck arched backward, their breasts thrust forward and emitting their characteristic 'gobbling' call.

[[File:Domestic turkey in Pakistan.jpg|thumb|Turkey in Pakistan]]
* The [[Broad Breasted White]] is the commercial turkey of choice for large scale industrial turkey farms, and consequently is the most consumed variety of the bird. Usually the turkey to receive a [[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation|"presidential pardon"]], a U.S. custom, is a Broad Breasted White.
* The [[Bronze (turkey)|Broad Breasted Bronze]] is another commercially developed strain of table bird.
* The [[Bronze (turkey)|Standard Bronze]] looks much like the Broad Breasted Bronze, except that it is single breasted, and can naturally breed.
* The [[Bourbon Red]] turkey is a smaller, non-commercial breed with dark reddish feathers with white markings.
* [[Slate (turkey)|Slate]], or Blue Slate, turkeys are a very rare breed with gray-blue feathers.
* The [[Black (turkey)|Black]] ("Spanish Black", "[[Norfolk]] Black") has very dark plumage with a green sheen.
* The [[Narragansett Turkey]] is a popular heritage breed named after Narraganset Bay in New England.
* The Chocolate is a rarer heritage breed with markings similar to a Black Spanish, but light brown instead of black in color. Common in the Southern U.S. and France before the Civil War.
* The [[Beltsville Small White]] is a small heritage breed, whose development started in 1934. The breed was introduced in 1941 and was admitted to the APA Standard in 1951. Although slightly bigger and broader than the Midget White, both are often mislabeled.
* The [[Midget White (turkey)|Midget White]] is a smaller heritage breed.

==Commercial production==
In commercial production, breeder farms supply eggs to hatcheries. After 28 days of [[Avian incubation|incubation]], the hatched poults are sexed and delivered to the grow-out farms; hens are raised separately from toms because of different growth rates.

In the UK, it is common to rear chicks in the following way.  Between one and seven days of age, chicks are placed into small (2.5&amp;nbsp;m) circular brooding pens to ensure they encounter food and water. To encourage feeding, they may be kept under constant light for the first 48 hours.  To assist [[thermoregulation]], air temperature is maintained at 35&amp;nbsp;°C for the first three days, then lowered by approximately 3&amp;nbsp;°C every two days to 18&amp;nbsp;°C at 37 days of age, and [[infra-red]] heaters are usually provided for the first few days.  Whilst in the pens, feed is made widely accessible by scattering it on sheets of paper in addition to being available in feeders.  After several days, the pens are removed, allowing the birds access to the entire rearing shed, which may contain tens of thousands of birds. The birds remain there for several weeks, after which they are transported to another unit.&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (2010)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M., (2010). Turkeys: Behavior, Management and Well-Being. In "The Encyclopaedia of Animal Science".  Wilson G. Pond and Alan W. Bell (Eds). Marcel Dekker. pp.  847-849&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of turkeys are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings of which there are many types.  Some types have slatted walls to allow ventilation, but many have solid walls and no windows to allow artificial lighting manipulations to optimise production.  The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a [[microbial flora]] requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between 18 and 21&amp;nbsp;°C. High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69&amp;nbsp;W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities.&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (2010)" /&gt;  Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth.&lt;ref name="Nixey, (1994)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nixey C | year = 1994 | title = Lighting for the production and welfare of turkeys | url = | journal = World's Poultry Science Journal | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 292–294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Light intensity is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather pecking.

Rations generally include corn and soybean meal, with added vitamins and minerals, and is adjusted for protein, carbohydrate and fat based on the age and nutrient requirements. Hens are slaughtered at about 14–16 weeks and toms at about 18–20 weeks of age when they can weigh over 20&amp;nbsp;kg compared to a mature male wild turkey which weighs approximately 10.8&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/wild-turkey/ Wild Turkey] National Geographic.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Welfare concerns===
[[File:Turkeys.jpg|thumb|right|Modern domestic turkeys under commercial conditions]]
Stocking density is an issue in the welfare of commercial turkeys and high densities are a major animal welfare concern.  Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare [[farm assurance]] schemes.  For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 58&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for males and females respectively.  In the UK, the [[RSPCA]] Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible stocking density to 25&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for turkeys reared indoors.&lt;ref name="Sandilands"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Sandilands, V. |editor2=Hocking, P.M.|year=2012|title=Alternative Systems for Poultry: Health, Welfare and Productivity|volume=30|publisher=Cabi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 61&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities.&lt;ref name="Mertrenchar"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martrenchar, A.|author2=Huonnic, D.|author3=Cotte, J.

If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.

Lighting manipulations used to optimise production can compromise welfare.  Long photoperiods combined with low light intensity can result in blindness from [[buphthalmia]] (distortions of the eye morphology) or [[retinal detachment]].

[[Feather pecking]] occurs frequently amongst commercially reared turkeys and can begin at 1 day of age.  This behaviour is considered to be re-directed foraging behaviour, caused by providing [[poultry]] with an impoverished foraging environment. To reduce feather pecking, turkeys are often [[debeaking|beak-trimmed]].  [[Bird vision#Ultraviolet|Ultraviolet]]-reflective markings appear on young birds at the same time as feather pecking becomes targeted toward these areas, indicating a possible link.&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Devereux, (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sherwin C.M. | author2 = Devereux C.L. | year = 1999 | title = A preliminary investigation of ultraviolet-visible markings on domestic turkey chicks and a possible role in injurious pecking | url = | journal = British Poultry Science | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 429–433 | doi=10.1080/00071669987151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commercially reared turkeys also perform head-pecking, which becomes more frequent as they sexually mature. When this occurs in small enclosures or environments with few opportunities to escape, the outcome is often fatal and rapid. Frequent monitoring is therefore essential, particularly of males approaching maturity. Injuries to the head receive considerable attention from other birds, and head-pecking often occurs after a relatively minor injury has been received during a fight or when a lying bird has been trodden upon and scratched by another.  Individuals being re-introduced after separation are often immediately attacked again. Fatal head-pecking can occur even in small (10 birds), stable groups. Commercial turkeys are normally reared in single-sex flocks. If a male is inadvertently placed in a female flock, he may be aggressively victimised (hence the term 'henpecked'). Females in male groups will be repeatedly mated, during which it is highly likely she will be injured from being trampled upon.

===Breeding and companies===
The dominant commercial breed is the Broad-breasted Whites (similar to "White Holland", but a separate breed), which have been selected for size and amount of meat. Mature toms are too large to achieve natural fertilization without injuring the hens, so their semen is collected, and hens are inseminated artificially. Several hens can be inseminated from each collection, so fewer toms are needed. The eggs of some turkey breeds are able to develop without fertilization, in a process called [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Discovered in Turkey Eggs: Parthenogenesis", ''World's Poultry Science Journal'' (1953), '''9''': 276-278 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, C D, "Parthenogenesis: Embryonic development in unfertilized eggs may impact normal fertilization and embryonic mortality", ''MSU Poultry Dept. Spring Newsletter'', '''1''':1. (reproduced on [http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/837/parthenogenesis-embryonic-development-in-unfertilized-eggs-may-impact-normal-fertilization-and-embryonic-mortality The Poultry Site])&lt;/ref&gt;  Breeders' meat is too tough for roasting, and is mostly used to make processed meats.

===Waste products===
Approximately two to four billion pounds of poultry feathers are produced every year by the poultry industry. Most are ground into a protein source for [[ruminant]] [[compound feed|animal feed]], which are able to digest the protein [[keratin]] of which feathers are composed. Researchers at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) have patented a method of removing the stiff [[quill]] from the fibers which make up the feather.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As this is a potential supply of natural fibers, research has been conducted at [[Philadelphia University]]'s School of Engineering and Textiles to determine textile applications for feather fibers. Turkey feather fibers have been blended with nylon and spun into [[yarn]], and then used for [[knitting]]. The yarns were tested for strength while the fabrics were evaluated as insulation materials. In the case of the yarns, as the percentage of turkey feather fibers increased, the strength decreased. In fabric form, as the percentage of turkey feather fibers increased, the heat retention capability of the fabric increased. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Turkeys are traditionally eaten as the main course of [[Christmas]] [[Christmas dinner|feasts]] in much of the [[English-speaking world]] ([[stuffed turkey]]) since appearing in [[England]] in the 16th century,&lt;ref name=DAV&gt;Davis, Karen (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHN2RKmI3gC&amp;pg=PA54 More than a meal: the turkey in history, myth, ritual, and reality] Lantern Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[Thanksgiving]] in the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|United States]] and [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canada]]. While eating turkey was once mainly restricted to special occasions such as these, turkey is now eaten year-round and forms a regular part of many diets.

Turkeys are sold sliced and ground, as well as "whole" in a manner similar to [[chicken]] with the head, feet, and feathers removed. Frozen whole turkeys remain popular. Sliced turkey is frequently used as a [[sandwich]] meat or served as [[cold cuts]]; in some cases, where recipes call for chicken, turkey can be used as a substitute. Additionally, ground turkey is frequently marketed as a healthy ground beef substitute. Without careful preparation, cooked turkey may end up less moist than other poultry meats, such as [[chicken]] or [[duck]].

Wild turkeys, while technically the same species as domestic turkeys, have a very different taste from farm-raised turkeys. In contrast to domestic turkeys, almost all wild turkey meat is "dark" (even the breast) and more intensely flavored. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild turkey meat with a gamier flavor in late summer due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkey that has fed predominantly on grass and grain has a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.

Unlike chicken, duck, and quail eggs, turkey eggs are not commonly sold as food due to the high demand for whole turkeys and the lower output of turkey eggs as compared with other fowl. The value of a single turkey egg is estimated to be about US $3.50 on the open market, substantially more than a single carton of one dozen chicken eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cecil Adams | title=Why can't you buy turkey eggs in stores? | work=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1262/why-cant-you-buy-turkey-eggs-in-stores | accessdate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Kasey-Dee Gardner | title=Why?

===Cooking===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Deep-frying]] --&gt;
{{cookbook|turkey}}
[[File:Hinduşka qızartması.jpg|thumb|right|Roast turkey]]
Both fresh and frozen turkeys are used for cooking; as with most foods, fresh turkeys are generally preferred, although they cost more. Around [[holiday]] seasons, high demand for fresh turkeys often makes them difficult to purchase without ordering in advance. For the frozen variety, the large size of the turkeys typically used for consumption makes defrosting them a major endeavor: a typically sized turkey will take several days to properly defrost.

Turkeys are usually [[baking|baked]] or [[roasting|roasted]] in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the remainder of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is [[brining|brined]] before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.

In some areas, particularly the [[Southern United States|American South]], turkeys may also be [[deep frying|deep fried]] in hot oil (often [[peanut oil]]) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a [[turkey fryer]]. Deep frying turkey has become something of a fad, with hazardous consequences for those unprepared to safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/offerings/perspectives/consumer/productsafety/turkeys/ | title = Product Safety Tips: Turkey Fryers | accessdate = December 21, 2007 | publisher = [[Underwriters Laboratories]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutritional value===
[[White meat|White turkey meat]] is often considered healthier than dark meat because of its lower fat content, but the nutritional differences are small. Although turkey is reputed to cause sleepiness, holiday dinners are commonly large meals served with carbohydrates, fats, and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere, all of which are bigger contributors to post-meal sleepiness than the [[tryptophan]] in turkey.&lt;ref name="sleepyturkey"&gt;{{cite web | title=Does eating turkey make you sleepy? | work=About.com | url=http://chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/aa110402a.htm | accessdate=May 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sleepyturkey2"&gt;{{cite web | title=Researcher talks turkey on Thanksgiving dinner droop | work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology News Office | url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/thanksgiving.html | accessdate=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey litter for fuel==
Although most commonly used as fertilizer, turkey litter (droppings mixed with bedding material, usually wood chips) is used as a fuel source in electric power plants. One such plant in western Minnesota provides 55 megawatts of power using 500,000 tons of litter per year. The plant began operating in 2007.&lt;ref name="HeraldTribune"&gt;{{cite web | title=Turkey-Manure Power Plant Raises Stink with Environmentalists | work=International Herald Tribune iht.com | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/06/europe/manure.php?page=1 | accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fancy mouse''' (“fancy” means “hobby” in this context) is a [[domesticated]] breed of the [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus'') usually kept as a type of [[pocket pet]]. Fancy mice have also been specially bred for exhibiting, with shows being held internationally. They are inexpensive compared to larger pets, but they are also comparatively short-lived (18 to 30 months). Fancy mice may be called "feeder mice" when they are sold as food for [[carnivorous]] pets such as [[snake]]s.&lt;ref name="the Rat and Mouse Club of America"&gt;[http://www.rmca.org/Resources/mousefaq.htm Mouse FAQ]. It is not only illegal to feed live animals to such carnivorous animals, however, but it is also not beneficial for the health of the predator. The Rat and Mouse Club of America. Rmca.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
{{Expand section|with=a list of varieties/breeds|date=May 2015}}
The term ''fancy mouse'' is used to describe a mouse that has been selectively bred for exhibition. Fancy mice can vary greatly in size, from small pet mice that are approximately {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long from nose to the tip of the tail, to show mice that measure {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} nose to tail. Pet mice weigh about {{convert|29|-|44|g|abbr=on|1}} but large show mice can weigh up to {{convert|130|g|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Artificial Selection|Artificial selection]] in fancy mice has created a variety of colors and patterns. These include colors like black, chocolate, blue, white, cream, lilac, red, fawn, champagne, cinnamon, golden agouti, silver agouti, silver and dove. Depending on the club, the standards may differ slightly.

Wild-caught specimens that become docile and are bred for many generations still fall under the ''fancy'' type.

== As pets ==
[[File:Petmouse.JPG|thumb|left|Fancy mice may be coloured and/or have markings not found in wild mice, such as this ''mis-marked'' Dutch.]]
The first written reference to mice kept as pets occurs in the ''[[Erya]]'', the oldest extant [[Chinese dictionary]], from a mention in an 1100 B.C. version.&lt;ref&gt;Royer, Nichole. [http://www.afrma.org/historymse.htm THE HISTORY OF FANCY MICE]. American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association. Afrma.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the breeding of fancy mice became popular through the introduction of [[Japan]]ese stock in the early 17th century. By 1895, [[Walter Maxey]] founded the National Mouse Club in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[England]], with its first official show held in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] that year. Since that time, mouse clubs have formed worldwide. Shows are held so [[Animal fancy|competitive breeder]]s can display their mice, where they are judged on color, body shape and behavior.

Mice are kept as pets in many countries for a number of reasons: Fancy mice are relatively small, inexpensive, never need bathing, and can learn to enjoy regular handling.&lt;ref name="the Rat and Mouse Club of America"/&gt; Female mice are popular with many owners since they tend to co-habitate with other mice better than males. Additionally, the urine of female fancy mice does not contain as strong an odor as that of the male mice. Bucks will often fight with and kill each other when housed together, despite being raised together, due to their very strong and unchangeable territorial instincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thefunmouse.com/info/keeping-mice-together.cfm#maleslivetogether | title = Can male mice live together? | accessdate = January 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to house male mice together without the risk of injury to one or both males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fancymice.info/smell.html |title=Do mice smell? |accessdate=May 1, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, however, prefer the personality and curiosity of male mice. It is a good idea to keep fancy mice in groups of at least two if possible, as mice are sociable animals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} However, if a buck and a doe of breeding age are put in the same cage it is possible for them to reproduce at a maximum frequency of once every three weeks. Litters of 5-18 are not unusual.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Showing ==
There are several clubs all over the world who host shows for mice, similar to rat shows. Shows are held in the US, the UK, and Australia most commonly.
Clubs include the FMBA (Fancy Mouse Breeders' Association, US), AFRMA (American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association, US), NMC (National Mouse Club, UK), and more.

A quote from the NMC describes the ideal mouse body type for showing: "The mouse must be long on body with long clean head, not too fine or pointed at the nose, the eyes should be large, bold and prominent. The ears large and tulip shaped, free from creases, carried erect with plenty of width between them. The body should be long and slim, a trifle arched over the loin and racy in appearance; the tail, which must be free from kinks should come well out of the back and be thick at the root or set-on, gradually tapering like a whip lash to a fine end, the length being about equal to that of the mouse's body. Unless the variety standard states otherwise, the coat should be short perfectly smooth, glossy and sleek to the hand. The mouse should be perfectly tractable and free from any vice and not subject to fits or other similar ailments. A mouse with absence of whiskers, blind in one or both eyes, carrying external parasites, having a tumor, sore or legs with fur missing, suffering from any obvious disease or deformity or kinked tail shall be disqualified."

== Caging ==

[[File:Fancy mice.jpg|thumb|right|Mice enjoy group housing and require nesting areas such as this wooden hide.]]
A cage with wire bars and plastic flooring is the most common type of housing. A span between cage bars of less than {{convert|9|mm|abbr=on}} prevents young mice from attempting to escape by forcing themselves through the bars, where they may get stuck. This can also help prevent [[predator]]y pets such as [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[snake]]s, and other [[carnivore]]s from killing and eating the mice.

Mice are naturally cautious of [[rat]]s, who may kill and consume them. This mice behavior is known as muricide (cf. [[Muricidal test]]).&lt;ref name=Tattersall/&gt; The mouse cage should be cleaned every couple of days to prevent odor and disinfected properly every 2 weeks to prevent infection and disease. In the wild, mice are able to co-exist with other small rodent species.&lt;ref name= Moro/&gt; Compared with larger [[mammal]]s, the mouse's small body makes it difficult to regulate body temperature effectively.&lt;ref name="the Rat and Mouse Club of America"/&gt; Thus, drafts and large fluctuations in temperature can adversely affect the health of mice.&lt;ref name="the Rat and Mouse Club of America"/&gt;

The best products for use in cage bedding are aspen wood shavings. Paper-pulp-based products are also available, as well as a variety of recycled products, though newspaper products may contain inks, dyes and other chemicals from the papermaking process. Cedar and pine, even kiln-dried, should not be used as they release aromatic oils that damage the respiratory system and can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory disease.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Jeff (1996-04-10) [http://www.ratfanclub.org/pine&amp;cdr.html Respiratory toxicity of cedar and pine wood: A review of the biomedical literature from 1986 through 1995]. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill via Ratfanclub.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that paper-pulp beddings may allow very high concentrations of ammonia to build up in cages, especially those with little ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vanderlip, Sharon Lynn |title=Mice: Everything About History, Care, Nutrition, Handling, and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ1KIGJsav0C|year=2001|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-1812-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small hideaways and toys (such as a [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] tube) are good to have in the cage.

== Feeding ==
[[File:Mice 25 Nov 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Hand-feeding 10-day-old mice]]
Food for fancy mice can range from specially formulated feed mix to kitchen scraps. Carrot, spinach, lettuce and other vegetables are often enjoyed by mice but should be given sparingly as such foods can result in diarrhea and life-threatening dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefunmouse.com/info/diet.cfm Mouse Diet]. The Fun Mouse. Retrieved on 2013-07-25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bread crumb]]s, [[wheat]] and [[rice]] can also be good for mice. Laboratories keeping mice as experimental subjects almost uniformly use a product called [[lab block]], a scientifically formulated blend originally designed for mice in laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fancymice.info/labdiets2.html |work=fancymice.info |title=Lab diets |accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to keep variety in their diets, mice can also eat [[oat]]s, oily [[seed]]s, clean [[eggshell]], [[breakfast cereal]], and [[stale bread]]. [[Fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s are part of a more natural and healthful [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Some owners give it to them as a treat after they do a trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fancymice.info/feeding2.html |work=fancymice.info |author=McKeown, Cait |title=Additional Foods |accessdate=May 1, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice often chew [[wood]] and other hard substances which keeps their [[teeth]] from growing too long; [[salt]] licks are also an option. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} As mice and rats have similar diets, some pet mouse owners choose to feed [[rat]] food. Although it is common practice to feed premixed diets designed for other rodents, for the longevity and health of the animal it is best to feed mouse-targeted diets. Diets for [[hamsters]], for instance, are known to contain higher protein than what is required for mice or rats. Homemade diets can be blended using [[grain]]s, [[rice]], [[oat]]s, [[seed]]s (such as [[peanut]], [[sunflower]], and [[pumpkin]]), high quality [[dog food]], as well as a number of other [[ingredients]].

[[House mice]] primarily feed on [[plant matter]], but they will also accept [[meat]] and [[dairy product]]s. Meats are full of [[protein]] and are great for pregnant or nursing mice. They will drink [[water]] but require little of it, relying mainly on the [[moisture]] present in their food. If a [[water source]] is provided, then a [[gravity bottle feeder]] is necessary for maintaining the cleanliness of the [[water]] supply. They will eat their [[feces]] to acquire nutrients produced by [[bacteria]] in their intestines in a behavior they share with [[rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s called [[coprophagy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hilscher-Conklin|first=Caryl|date=July–August 1998|url=http://www.rmca.org/Articles/coprophagy.htm |title=Coprophagy: Rattus Biologicus: Healthy Behavior For Your Rats |work=Rat &amp; Mouse Gazette|publisher=Rat &amp; Mouse Club of America |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[House mice]], like other rodents, do not [[vomiting|vomit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060537 |pmid=23593236 |pmc=3622671 |laysummary=http://www.livescience.com/28764-rodents-inability-to-vomit.html |laysource=Live Science |laydate=April 16, 2013|title=Why Can't Rodents Vomit?

== Health ==
A healthy fancy mouse will live on average 18 to 30 months, depending on genetic predisposition. Like most mammals mice are susceptible to [[mites]], [[ticks]] and other skin parasites, as well as [[intestinal parasites]]. The cage should be cleaned regularly, and preferably treated with anti-mite spray. Mice are particularly sensitive to drafts and may pick up colds and other flu-like conditions. Mice can also over-groom when stressed, leading to skin irritations and fur loss. Older mice are susceptible to [[tumors]], especially breast cancer in females as the mammary tissue is distributed around much of the body. Persistent problems should be referred to a [[veterinarian]], although finding a veterinarian with experience in treating mice can be difficult.

Like people, fancy mice can become obese if they overeat and do not get enough physical activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening [[cardiovascular disorders]] and [[diabetes]] as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice get enough exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a wire cage with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and can be difficult to retrieve.

As rodents, mice must gnaw to keep their [[incisors]] from growing too long. Overgrown teeth can cause occlusion (blockage) of the mouth, which in extreme cases can lead to starvation. Hard foodstuffs, small pieces of wood or specially prepared blocks can suit this purpose, although some mice can grind their teeth together ("[[bruxism|bruxing]]") to keep them short. In rare cases a mouse may not be able to gnaw effectively, either from malformed incisors or [[jaw]]s, and so its teeth must be trimmed by a veterinarian.

Mice [[Personal grooming|self-groom]] and do not need to be bathed, unless they have a skin condition which requires special treatment.

Also, like people, mice can get diarrhea. For humans in developed countries with access to clean water, this is usually not a life-threatening condition. For mice though, it can be. Once a mouse gets diarrhea, since it is so small, it can very easily lose too much liquid, dehydrate, and die.

== Handling ==

Although mice are small animals and care must be taken to avoid injury, they are also surprisingly robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as they are generally considered non-aggressive. Mice, especially males who are wild and territorial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fancymice.info/social.htm|title=Socialising/Taming Your Mouse|work=fancymice.info|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228072600/http://www.fancymice.info/social.htm|archivedate=December 28, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=September 18, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people

Unfortunately mice cannot be house trained and will often [[defecate]] and [[urinate]] while first being handled, especially if they are nervous. The feces of a healthy mouse consist of a relatively innocuous solid pellet a few millimeters long. However their urine is often pungent, particularly with males, and could stain fabric.

== Breeding ==

Mice have a rapid reproduction rate; the [[gestation]] period is approximately 19 to 23 days. The typical [[litter (animal)|litter]] size is 4 to 12 young. In some instances, up to thirty young have been born. Males can mate with the female as soon as the litter is born, which means that a female could become pregnant with another litter within 3 days of giving birth. Female mice should not be bred before 12 weeks or after 8 months; doing so can be very dangerous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fancymice.info/breeding.htm |title=Breeding (Reproduction) |work=fancymice.info |accessdate=May 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611232733/http://www.fancymice.info/breeding.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some mice can die while giving birth. Females come into [[estrus|heat]] around every three to five days, so the pair can be kept together for up to ten days.
Baby mice, called pinkies or [[Names given to animals young|pup]]s, are born [[Blindness|blind]], naked, and [[deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fancymice.info/babiesdevelop.html |work=fancymice.info |title=How Do Babies Develop? |accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their eyes are closed and their ears are stuck to the sides of their heads.

Ears open at three to five days, and the pups will start [[Animal communication|vocalizing]]. Eyes open at 14 days, and the babies will start exploring the world around them. At three weeks old they look like miniature versions of adult mice. At four weeks the males in the litter should be separated out lest they impregnate their mother and sisters, while the females can be left in with the mother.

'''''Bos''''' (from [[Latin]] ''bōs: [[cow]], [[ox]], [[bull]]'')  is the [[genus]] of wild and [[domestication|domestic]] [[cattle]]. ''Bos'' can be divided into four [[subgenus|subgenera]]: ''Bos'', ''Bibos'', ''Novibos'', and ''Poephagus'', but these divisions are controversial. The genus has five [[extant taxon|extant]] species. However, this may rise to seven if the [[domesticated]] varieties are counted as separate species, and nine if the closely related genus ''[[Bison]]'' is also included.&lt;ref&gt;Groves, C. P., 1981. Systematic relationships in the Bovini (Artiodactyla, Bovidae). ''Zeitschrift für Zoologische Systematik und Evolutionsforschung'', '''4''':264-278., quoted in Don E. Wilson &amp; DeeAnn M. Reeder (editors). 2005. ''Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference'' (3rd ed), Johns Hopkins University Press: "Bison". ([http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&amp;id=14200668 online edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922131805/http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&amp;id=14200668 |date=2011-09-22 }})&lt;/ref&gt;
Most modern breeds of domesticated cattle are believed to have originated from the extinct [[aurochs]].

==Anatomy and morphology==
Most species are grazers, with long tongues to twist the plant material they favor and large teeth to break up the plant material they ingest.  They are [[ruminant]]s, having a four-chambered stomach that allows them to break down plant material.

==Range and distribution==
There are about 1.3 billion domestic cattle alive today, making them one of the world's most numerous mammals. Members of this genus are currently found in Africa, Asia, eastern and western Europe, parts of North America, South America and also in Oceania. Their habitats vary greatly depending on the particular species; they can be found in prairies, rain forests, wetlands, savannas and temperate forests.

==Ecology, behavior and life history==
Most ''Bos'' species have a lifespan of 18–25 years in the wild, with up to 36 being recorded in captivity. They have a 9–11 month [[gestation]], depending on the species and birth one or, rarely, two young in the spring.

Most species travel in herds ranging in size from 10 members into the hundreds. Within most herds, there is one [[bull]] (male) for all the [[cow]]s (female). [[Dominance (ethology)|Dominance]] is important in the herds; calves will usually inherit their mother's position in the [[hierarchy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

They are generally [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]], resting in the hot part of the day and being active morning and afternoon. In areas where humans have encroached on the territory of a herd, they may turn [[nocturnal]]. Some species are also migratory, moving with food and water availability.

==Evolutionary history==
Modern species of ''Bos'' are thought to have evolved from a single ancestor, the [[aurochs]] (''B. primigenius''). This particular species survived until the early 17th century when it was hunted to [[extinct]]ion as the last aurochs, a female, died in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] [[Opinion 2027|resolved a long-standing dispute]] about the naming of those species (or pairs of species) of ''Bos'' that contain both wild and domesticated forms. The commission "conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms", confirming ''Bos primigenius'' for the aurochs and ''Bos gaurus'' for the gaur. If domesticated cattle and gayal are considered separate species, they are to be named ''Bos taurus'' and ''Bos frontalis''; however, if they are considered part of the same species as their wild relatives, the common species are to be named ''Bos primigenius'' and ''Bos gaurus''.

The '''gayal''' (''Bos frontalis''), also known as '''mithun''', is a large domestic [[bos|bovine]] distributed in [[Northeast India]], [[Bangladesh]], northern [[Myanmar]] and in [[Yunnan]], [[China]].&lt;ref name=Simoons1984&gt;Simoons, F. J. (1984). ''Gayal or mithan''. In: Mason, I. L. (ed.) ''Evolution of Domesticated Animals''. Longman, London. Pages 34–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
There are two major hypotheses on the origin of the gayal:
* It was domesticated from wild [[gaur]];&lt;ref name=Simoons1984 /&gt;
* It is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] descendant from crossing of wild gaur and domestic cattle, either ''[[Zebu|Bos indicus]]'' or ''[[Cattle|Bos taurus]]''.&lt;ref name=Payne1970&gt;Payne WJA. (1970). ''Breeds and Breeding VI''. ''Cattle Production in the Tropics''. London: Longman Group Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
To date neither hypothesis has been proven conclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uzzaman |first1=Md. Rasel |last2=Bhuiyan |first2=Md.

The gayal differs in several important particulars from the [[gaur]]:&lt;ref name=Lydekker1888&gt;Lydekker, R. (1888–1890). [https://archive.org/stream/newnatuhist02lyderich#page/178/mode/2up ''The new natural history'' Volume 2]. Printed by order of the Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History), London. Pages 179–181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is somewhat smaller, with proportionately shorter limbs, and stands much lower at the [[withers]].
* The ridge on the back is less developed, and bulls have a larger [[dewlap]] on the throat.
* The head is shorter and broader, with a perfectly flat forehead and a straight line between the bases of the [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]].
* The thick and massive horns are less flattened and much less curved than in the gaur, extending almost directly outwards from the sides of the head, and curving somewhat upwards at the tips, but without any inward inclination. Their extremities are thus much farther apart than in the gaur.
* The female gayal is much smaller than the bull, and has scarcely any dewlap on the throat.
* The skin colour of the head and body is blackish-brown in both sexes, and the lower portion of the limbs are white or yellowish.
* The horns are of uniform blackish tint from base to tip.

Some domesticated gayals are parti-coloured, while others are completely white.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Gayals are essentially inhabitants of hill-forests. In India, semi-domesticated gayals are kept by several [[South Asian ethnic groups|ethnic groups]] living in the hills of [[Tripura]], [[Mizoram]], [[Assam]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], and [[Nagaland]]. They also occur in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]].&lt;ref name=Lydekker1888/&gt; In northern Burma, they occur in the [[Kachin State]], and in adjacent Yunnan are found only in the Trung ({{zh|s=独龙河}}) and [[Salween River]] basins.&lt;ref name=Simoons1984/&gt;

The role of the mithun is central to the lives of many residents of these areas, including [[transhumance|transhumant]] ones who pair mithun management with [[sago palm]] harvesting:{{quote|Although livestock is highly characteristic of the high Himalayan way of life in general, with yaks and sheep being predominant species until recently, the mithun, or gayal (''Bos frontalis'') is the most prominent animal exploited by Eastern Himalayan groups ... The mithun is a semi-domesticate, managed in fenced tracts of forests rather than being kept in or near villages. Outside North East India, mithun are primarily imported for the purpose of cross- breeding with other bovids, for example in Bhutan. It is very common among Eastern Himalayan languages to find lexical sets denoting fauna in which the mithun is lexicalized as a “prototypical” meat animal, with all other terms being derived ... Terms for ‘mithun’ in other languages of Arunachal Pradesh are typically cognate with Aka fu (e.g. Miji ʃu, Koro sù, Puroik ʧa and Proto-Tani *ɕo), suggesting that this is probably not a case of semantic shift from a wild species. The implication is that the semi-wild mithun was seen as the core species, and the true domesticates such as cattle, which arrived subsequently, as marginal to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Blench, R. and M. W. Post |editor1-last=Owen-Smith |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Hill |editor2-first=N. |title=Trans-Himalayan Linguistics Historical and Descriptive Linguistics of the Himalayan Area |date=2013 |publisher=De Gruyter |location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-11-031083-2|pages=71–104|chapter=Rethinking Sino-Tibetan phylogeny from the perspective of North East Indian languages: Blench, R. and M. W. Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
In Nagaland, the animals are kept semi-wild, and live in herds, being watched over by special caretakers assigned by the villages or the owner of the herd. They respond to a horn kept specially for the individual caretaker or actual owner to call them. From birth until the time of butchering or market, the Mithun remain in the herd, and roam mostly freely throughout the forests.

== Taxonomy ==
In his first description of 1804, [[Aylmer Bourke Lambert]] applied the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Bos frontalis'' to a domestic specimen probably from [[Chittagong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellerman |first=J. R. |last2=Morrison-Scott |first2=T. C. S. |year=1966 |url=https://archive.org/stream/checklistofindia00elle#page/380/mode/2up |title=Checklist of Palaearctic and Indian mammals 1758 to 1946 |edition=Second |location=London |publisher=British Museum of Natural History |page=380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] fixed the first available [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] based on a wild population that the name for this wild species is valid by virtue of its being antedated by a name based on a domestic form. Most authors have adopted the binomial ''Bos frontalis'' for the domestic species as valid for the [[taxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gentry |first=A. |last2=Clutton-Brock |first2=J. |last3=Groves |first3=C. P. |year=2004 |url=http://arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/J%20Arch%20Sci.pdf |title=The naming of wild animal species and their domestic derivatives |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=31 |issue= |pages=645–651 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2003.10.006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408044739/http://arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/J%20Arch%20Sci.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analysis]] corroborates the taxonomic assessment that the gayal is an independent ''Bos'' species originating [[Matrilineality|matrilineally]] from [[gaur]], [[zebu]] and [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guolong |first=M. |last2=Hong |first2=C. |last3=Shiping |first3=L. |last4=Hongyu |first4=C. |last5=Dejun |first5=J. |last6=Rongqing |first6=G. |last7=Chunfang |first7=C. |last8=Yonghong |first8=L. |year=2007 |title=Phylogenetic Relationships and Status Quo of Colonies for Gayal Based on Analysis of Cytochrome b Gene Partial Sequences |journal=Journal of Genetics and Genomics |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=413–419 |doi=10.1016/S1673-8527(07)60045-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
To the Idu Mishmi, Nyishi people or [[Adi people]]  (Bangni-Booker [[Lhoba]]s incl pasi, padam, minyong, Galong now Galo), the possession of gayal is the traditional measure of a family's wealth. Gayal are not milked or put to work but given supplementary care while grazing in the woods, until they are ritually slaughtered or killed for local consumption. Mithun's are wild and each family has a very indigenous marking as a cut on the ear.

The gayal is the state animal of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Nagaland]]. Gayals play an important role in the social life of the people in Arunachal Pradesh. Marriages are not fixed until the bridegroom's family gives at least one gayal to the bride's household.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Gayals are left in the forest, where they usually stay within a small perimeter. Females are usually aggressive when with calves, and there are instances known when people have been severely injured after being gored by one. Males are usually more docile.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== National Research Centre on Mithun ==
The National Research Centre on Mithun was established at Jharnapani, Dimapur, [[Nagaland]] under the Indian Council of Agriculture Research.
The mandate of the institute was redefined in 1997 and 2006. Currently, the National Research Centre on Mithun is functioning for developing the scientific and sustainable mithun rearing system and for catering the needs of mithun farmers with the following mandates:
* Identification, evaluation and characterization of mithun [[germplasm]] available in the country.
* Conservation and improvement of mithun for meat and milk.
* Act as a repository of germplasm and information centre on mithun.

The '''Catalina macaw''' is a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between the [[blue-and-gold macaw]] and [[scarlet macaw]]. Catalina macaws are [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], so they don't have a true scientific name. The best way to represent these birds in taxonomy is by the expression ''Ara ararauna'' × ''Ara macao''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/catalina-macaws-390833|title= The Spruce - Catalina Macaws|website=www.thespruce.com/|language=en|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

Catalina macaws are only produced in captivity, by crossing a blue-and-yellow macaw with a scarlet macaw. Therefore, they originate in the homes of bird breeders around the world.

==Size==

Catalina macaws generally weigh 2 - 3 pounds and can reach up to 35 inches in length from the beak to the tip of the tail feathers.

==Feeding==

Like any large parrot, a Catalina macaw should be fed a diet that includes a high quality seed/pellet mix, along with fresh bird-safe [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]].

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and [[predator]]y [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a [[social animal|social species]], and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[Cat communication|mewing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]] and [[Guttural|grunting]]) as well as [[cat pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].&lt;ref name="Moelk" /&gt;

The origin of the English word ''[[wikt:cat#English|cat]]'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|catt}}) and its counterparts in other [[Germanic languages]] (such as [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Katze}}), descended from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*kattōn-'', is controversial.

Many references refer to "Berber" ([[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]) {{lang|kab|kaddîska}}, 'wildcat', and [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] {{lang|nub|kadīs}} as possible sources or cognates, but M.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[Purebred cat|purebred (or pure-bred) cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s (by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type), or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral [[subspecies]] from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. The semi-[[Feral animal|feral]] cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Truly [[feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas, foraging for food and sometimes intermittently fed by people, but are typically wary of human interaction.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw1999" /&gt;

Cats have seven [[cervical vertebrae]], as do almost all [[mammals]]; 13 [[thoracic vertebrae]] (humans have 12); seven [[lumbar vertebrae]] (humans have five); three [[sacrum|sacral vertebrae]] like most mammals (humans have five); and a variable number of [[caudal vertebrae]] in the tail (humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal [[coccyx]]).&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Study of the Cat with Reference to Human Beings |last=Walker |first=Warren F. |edition=4th Revised |date=1982 |publisher=[[Cengage|Thomson Learning (Cengage)]] |isbn=978-0-03-057914-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility.

[[File:Cat skull.jpg|thumb|left|Cat skull]]
The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large [[eye socket]]s and a powerful specialized jaw.&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;*{{Cite book |title=The Cat: Its Behavior, Nutrition, and Health |last=Case |first=Linda P. |date=2003 |publisher=[[Iowa State University]] Press |location=Ames |isbn=978-0-8138-0331-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its [[spinal cord]], causing irreversible [[paralysis]] and death.&lt;ref name="Smith1992"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Structure, Function and Evolution of teeth |last1=Smith |first1=Patricia |last2=Tchernov |first2=Eitan |date=1992 |page=217 |publisher=[[Freund Publishing House]] |isbn=978-965-222-270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Smith1992" /&gt; The [[premolar]] and first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] together compose the [[carnassial]] pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small [[molar (tooth)|molars]] cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt;{{rp|37}} Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.&lt;ref name="Carr1978"&gt;{{Cite book |first=William H.

Cats, like dogs, are [[digitigrade]]s. They walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.&lt;ref name="Lacquaniti 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Motor Patterns in Walking |last1=Lacquaniti |first1=F. |last2=Grasso |first2=R. |last3=Zago |first3=M. |journal=News Physiol. Sci. |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=168–174 |date=1 August 1999 |pmid=11390844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all [[Felinae|felines]], they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Christensen 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Outwitting Cats |last=Christensen |first=Wendy |page=23 |publisher=[[Globe Pequot]] |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-59228-240-1 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=WmuQQXU6EtAC&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like almost all members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and retractable [[claw]]s.&lt;ref name="Russell 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Claw Retraction and Protraction in the Carnivora: The Cheetah (Acinonyx Jubatus) as an Atypical Felid |last1=Russell |first1=Anthony P. |last2=Bryant |first2=Harold N. |journal=Journal of Zoology |date=2001 |volume=254 |issue=1 |pages=67–76 |doi=10.1017/S0952836901000565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and [[fur]] around the [[paw]]'s toe pads.

===Physiology===
Cats are familiar and easily kept animals, and their physiology has been particularly well studied; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals, but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; For instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: Humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around {{convert|52|°C|°F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt;{{rp|46}} and can tolerate temperatures of up to {{convert|56|°C|°F|abbr=on}} if they have access to water.&lt;ref name="SDCN"&gt;{{Cite book |author=US National Research Council Subcommittee on Dog and Cat Nutrition  |author-link=National Research Council (United States) |title=Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] |location=Washington DC |date=2006 |page=292 |isbn=978-0-309-08628-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nutrition====

Cats are [[obligate carnivores]]: their [[physiology]] has evolved to efficiently process meat, and they have difficulty digesting plant matter.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Nutrition of the domestic cat, a mammalian carnivore |last1=MacDonald |first1=M.

Cats do eat [[grass]] occasionally. A proposed explanation is that cats use grass as a source of [[folic acid]]. Another is that it is used to supply [[dietary fiber]], helping the cat [[defecation|defecate]] more easily and expel parasites and other harmful material through feces and [[vomit]].&lt;ref name="EatGrass"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/why-do-cats-eat-grass/ |title=Why Do Cats Eat Grass? |work=AnimalPlanet.com |date=2012-05-15|access-date=2 April 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170403194652/http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/why-do-cats-eat-grass/ |archive-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the [[amino acid]] [[arginine]], and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal.&lt;ref name="Morris 1978"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Arginine: An Essential Amino Acid for the Cat |last1=Morris |first1=J. G. |last2=Rogers |first2=Q. R. |journal=Journal of Nutrition |volume=108 |issue=12 |pages=1944–1953 |date=1 December 1978 |pmid=722344|doi=10.1093/jn/108.12.1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arginine]] is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the [[enzyme]]s [[aminotransferase]] and [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] which are responsible for the synthesis of ornithine and citrulline in the [[small intestine]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bauer, J. (1998). Nutritional Uniqueness of Cats. ''Veterinary Quarterly,20''(Sup1), 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Citrulline]] would typically go on to the [[kidney]]s to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the [[urea cycle]] in order to convert the toxic component [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] that can then be excreted in the urine.  Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to hyperammonemia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The symptoms of [[hyperammonemia]] include [[lethargy]], vomiting, [[ataxia]], [[hyperesthesia]] and can be serious enough to induce death and [[coma]] in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other [[amino acid]]s, which will continue to be [[Catabolism|catabolized]] by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.

Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce [[taurine]],{{refn|group=note|name=AminoAcid|Taurine is sometimes called an amino acid, and indeed is an [[acid]] containing an [[amino]] group, it is not an [[amino acid]] in the usual biochemical meaning of the term, which refers to compounds containing both an [[amino]] and a [[carboxyl]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/amino-acid |title=the definition of amino acid |work=Dictionary.com |access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} with a deficiency in this nutrient causing [[macular degeneration]], wherein the cat's retina slowly breaks down, causing irreversible blindness.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; This is due to the hepatic activity of cystinesulfinic acid decarboxylase being low in cats.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schullerlevis |first1=G. |last2=Mehta |first2=P. |last3=Rudelli |first3=R. |last4=Sturman |first4=J. |date=1990 |title=Immunological Consequences of Taurine Deficiency in Cats |journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=321–331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limits the ability of cats to [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesize]] the taurine they need from its precursor, the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]], which ultimately results in inadequate taurine production needed for normal function.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Deficiencies in taurine result in compensated function of feline cardiovascular and reproductive systems.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These abnormalities can also be accompanied by developmental issues in the central nervous system along with degeneration of the retina.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

[[Niacin]] is an essential vitamin for the cat; dietary deficiency can lead to anorexia, weight loss and an increase in body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=US National Research Council Subcommittee on Dog and Cat Nutrition |author-link=National Research Council (United States) |date=2006 |chapter-url= http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10668 |chapter=The Role of Vitamins and Minerals in the Diet for Cats |title=Nutrient Requirements of Cats and Dogs |isbn=978-0-309-08628-8 |location=Washington DC |publisher=[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]]. |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060907101530/http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10668 |archive-date=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biosynthesis of [[niacin]] occurs by metabolism of [[tryptophan]] via the [[kynurenine pathway]] to [[quinolinic acid]], the niacin precursor. However, cats have a high activity of picolinic acid carboxylase, which converts one of the intermediates to [[picolinic acid]] instead of quinolinic acid.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=J. |date=2002 |title=Idiosyncratic nutrient requirements of cats appear to be diet-induced evolutionary adaptations |journal=Nutrition Research Reviews |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=153–168 |doi=10.1079/nrr200238|pmid=19087402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, niacin can become deficient and require [[Dietary supplement|supplementation]].&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=M.

Preformed [[vitamin A]] is required in the cat for retinal and reproductive health. Vitamin A is considered to be a fat-soluble vitamin and is seen as essential in a cat's diet. Normally, the conversion of [[beta-carotene]]s into vitamin A occurs in the intestine (more specifically the mucosal layer) of species, however cats lack the ability to undergo this process.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Both the kidney and liver are contributors to the use of vitamin A in the body of the majority of species while the cats liver does not produce the enzyme [[Beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] which converts the beta-carotene into [[retinol]] (vitamin A).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Nutritional Requirements of the Cat |date=1982 |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=40 |issue=9 |pages=283–285 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1982.tb05341.x}}{{complete citation needed|date=December 2017|reason=Author(s) missing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To summarize: cats do not have high levels of this enzyme leading to the cleavage and oxidation of [[carotenoid]]s not taking place.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

[[Cholecalciferol|Vitamin D3]] is a dietary requirement for cats as they lack the ability to synthesize vitamin D3 from sunlight.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Girard |first1=N. |last2=Servet |first2=E. |last3=Hennet |first3=P. |last4=Biourge |first4=V. |date=2010 |title=Tooth Resorption and Vitamin D 3 Status in Cats Fed Premium Dry Diets |url= |journal=Journal of Veterinary Dentistry |volume=27 |issue=3|pages=142–147 |doi=10.1177/089875641002700301|pmid=21038831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats obtain high levels of the enzyme 7-dehydrocholestrol delta 7 reductase which causes immediate conversion of vitamin D3 from sunlight to [[7-Dehydrocholesterol|7-dehydrocholesterol]].&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=James G |date=1999 |title=Ineffective vitamin D synthesis in cats is reversed by an inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta(super 7)-reductase |url= |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=129 |issue=4|pages=903–908 |pmid=10203568 |doi=10.1093/jn/129.4.903}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fat soluble vitamin is required in cats for bone formation through the promotion of calcium retention, along with nerve and muscle control through absorption of [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

Cats, like all mammals, need to get [[linoleic acid]], an [[essential fatty acid]], from their diet. Most mammals can convert linoleic acid to [[arachidonic acid]], as well as the [[omega 3 fatty acids]] ([[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]]) through the activity of enzymes, but this process is very limited in cats.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; The Δ6-desaturase enzyme eventually converts linoleic acid, which is in its salt form linoleate, to arachidonate (salt form of arachidonic acid) in the liver, but this enzyme has very little activity in cats.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; This means that arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid for cats as they lack the ability to create required amounts of linoleic acid.  Deficiency of arachidonic acid in cats is related to problems in growth, can cause injury and inflammation to skin (e.g. around the mouth) decreased platelet aggregation, fatty liver, increase in birth defects of kittens whose queens were deficient during pregnancy, and reproductive failure in queens.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; [[Arachidonic acid]] can also be metabolized to [[eicosanoids]] that create inflammatory responses which are needed to stimulate proper growth and repair mechanisms in the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=M.

Cats have excellent [[night vision]] and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt;{{rp|43}} This is partly the result of cat eyes having a [[tapetum lucidum]], which reflects any light that passes through the [[retina]] back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.&lt;ref name="Olliver 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comparative Morphology of the Tapetum Lucidum (among Selected Species) |last1=Ollivier |first1=F.

To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces.

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].&lt;ref name="Nash FS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Do Cats Like High Places? |last=Nash |first=Holly |url= http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1313&amp;aid=1125 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080102145008/http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=1&amp;cat=1313&amp;articleid=1125 |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=PetEducation.com |publisher=[[Drs.

Cats without a tail (e.g. many specimens of the [[Manx cat|Manx]] and [[Cymric cat|Cymric]] breeds) also have this ability, since a cat mostly relies on leg movement and conservation of [[angular momentum]] to set up for landing, and the tail is little used for this feat.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 1998"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010410235503/http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date=10 April 2001 |title=How Does a Cat Always Land on Its Feet?  |last=Nguyen  |first=Huy D.  |work=Dynamics II (ME 3760) Course Materials  |date=1998  |publisher=School of Medical Engineering, [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] |access-date=15 May 2007

In particular, older cats may show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.&lt;ref name="Levine 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Intercat Aggression in Households Following the Introduction of a New Cat |last1=Levine |first1=E. |last2=Perry |first2=P. |last3=Scarlett |first3=J. |last4=Houpt |first4=K. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |issue=3–4 |date=2005 |pages=325–336 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.07.006 |volume=90 |access-date=8 April 2009 |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/jcha/330_cats_introducing.pdf |format=PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225932/http://faculty.washington.edu/jcha/330_cats_introducing.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
{{main|Cat communication}}
Domestic cats use many [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s for communication, including [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]]/[[snarl]]ing, [[Guttural|grunting]], and several different forms of [[meow]]ing.&lt;ref name="Moelk"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Vocalizing in the House-cat; A Phonetic and Functional Study |last=Moelk |first=Mildred |journal=The American Journal of Psychology |date=April 1944 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=184–205 |doi=10.2307/1416947 |jstor=1416947}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jensen |first=Per |title=The Ethology of Domestic Animals |series="Modular Text" series |publisher=[[Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International]] |location=Wallingford, England |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84593-536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} Their types of [[Cat body language|body language]], including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood.

Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's [[social hierarchy]], with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals.&lt;ref name="Cafazzo" /&gt; Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by [[social grooming]], which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.&lt;ref name="Crowell-davis2004" /&gt;

Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] kittens.

However, felids of the genus ''[[Panthera]]'' ([[tiger]], [[lion]], [[jaguar]], and [[leopard]]) also produce non-continuous sounds, called ''chuffs'', similar to purring, but only when exhaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.panthera.org/ |title=Panthera |access-date=23 November 2013 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131126101950/http://www.panthera.org/ |archive-date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grooming===

[[File:Housecat Grooming Itself.webm|thumb|A [[tabby cat|tabby]] housecat uses its brush-like tongue to groom itself, licking its fur to straighten it.]]

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.&lt;ref name="hairballs" /&gt; The cat's [[tongue]] has backwards-facing spines about 500&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] long, which are called [[Lingual papilla|papillae]].

Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate [[hairball]]s of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about {{convert|2|–|3|cm|1|abbr=on}} long. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the [[gut (anatomy)|gut]], as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.&lt;ref name="hairballs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hadzima |first=Eva |title=Everything You Need to Know About Hairballs |date=2016 |url= http://www.dewintonvet.com/everything-you-need-know-about-hairballs/ |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104436/http://www.dewintonvet.com/everything-you-need-know-about-hairballs/ |archive-date=6 October 2016

===Fighting===
Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.&lt;ref name="Lindell"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lindell |first=Ellen M. |title=Intercat Aggression: A Retrospective Study Examining Types of Aggression, Sexes of Fighting Pairs, and Effectiveness of Treatment |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=December 1997 |volume=55 |issue=1–2 |pages=153–162 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(97)00032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among feral cats, the most common reason for [[Catfight (animal behavior)|cat fighting]] is competition between two males to mate with a female.

Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to [[sex hormone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Determining the Optimal age for Gonadectomy of Dogs and Cats |doi=10.2460/javma.231.11.1665 |date=2007 |last1=Kustritz |first1=Margaret V.

[[File:GAto.jpg|thumb|An arched back, raised fur and an open-mouthed hiss can all be signs of aggression in a domestic cat.]]

When cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.&lt;ref name="behaviourguide"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224154137/http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archive-date=24 February 2009 |title=Cat Behavior: Body Language |work=AnimalPlanet.com |date=2007 |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.&lt;ref name="HSUS"&gt;{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041214181209/http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html |url= http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html |title=Aggression Between Family Cats. |archive-date=14 December 2004 |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref name="Pederson 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection |last1=Pedersen |first1=N.

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to "play" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Why do cats play with their food? |url= http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html |work=Arizona Daily Sun |access-date=15 August 2011 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110319041928/http://www.azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html |archive-date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is referred to in the [[idiom]] "cat-and-mouse game" or simply "[[cat and mouse]]".

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the [[dominance hierarchy]], in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.&lt;ref name="Leyhausen 1978"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cat Behavior: The Predatory and Social Behavior of Domestic and Wild Cats |last=Leyhausen |first=Paul |date=1978 |publisher=[[Garland STPM Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8240-7017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist and zoologist [[Desmond Morris]], in his 1986 book ''Catwatching'', suggests, when cats bring home mice or birds, they are attempting to teach their human to hunt, or trying to help their human as if feeding "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten".&lt;ref name="Morris Catwatching 1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Catwatching: Why Cats Purr and Everything Else You Ever Wanted to Know |last=Desmond |first=Morris |date=1986 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing]]

A veterinarian and columnist for ''[[Mercola]] Healthy Pets'', Karen Shaw Becker, has compiled a list of the fastest and most athletic cat breeds. First is the [[Egyptian Mau]], which can clock up to 30 miles per hour, faster than any other domestic cat breed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2015/05/22/9-fastest-cat-breeds.aspx |last=Becker |first=Karen |date=22 May 2015 |title=The Cat That Can Run Up to 30 mph: Fastest Domestic Cat Breed in the World |work=Mercola Healthy Pets |access-date= 28 June 2018 |publisher=[[Joseph Mercola]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=June 2018|reason=This is a "fluff" primary source (an advice/opinion column) which provides no indication of its own sources, and which is published by a WP:FRINGE "alternative health" and anti-vaccination veterinary quack; Mercola.com has been independently reviewed as "likely to mislead consumers by offering one-sided, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information."}} In descending order, Becker lists the other swift domestic cats: the [[Abyssinian cat]], the [[Somali cat]], the [[Bengal cat]], the [[Savannah cat]], the [[Manx cat]] ("He can jump and accelerate through the house like there's no tomorrow.

The average house cat can outspeed the average house dog (excluding those born to run and race, such as the [[greyhound]] and the [[cheetah]]), but they excel at sprinting, not at long-distance running.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play.

Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become [[habituation|habituated]]) in a toy they have played with before.&lt;ref name="Hall 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Object Play in Adult Domestic Cats: The Roles of Habituation and Disinhibition |last=Hall |first=Sarah L. |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=2002 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=263–271 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry.&lt;ref name="Hall 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hall |first=Sarah L. |title=The Influence of Hunger on Object Play by Adult Domestic Cats |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=June 1998 |volume=58 |issue=1–2 |pages=143–150 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(97)00136-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the [[intestine]]s, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death.&lt;ref name="MacPhail 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacPhail |first=Catriona |title=Gastrointestinal obstruction |journal=Clinical Techniques in Small Animal Practice |date=November 2002 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=178–183 |doi=10.1053/svms.2002.36606 |pmid=12587284 |pmc=2480448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a [[laser pointer]]'s dot, which cats may chase.&lt;ref name="Pocono 2006"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061210/NEWS01/612100320/-1/NEWS |title=Fat Indoor Cats Need Exercise |date=10 December 2006 |work=[[Pocono Record]] |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090714065943/http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061210%2FNEWS01%2F612100320%2F-1%2FNEWS |archive-date=14 July 2009}}{{tertiary|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Radiography of a pregnant cat.jpg|thumb|Radiography of a pregnant cat (about one month and a half)]]
Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.&lt;ref name="compendium" /&gt; Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about 1&amp;nbsp;mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which acts to [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induce ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.&lt;ref name="Aronson 1967"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Penile Spines of the Domestic Cat: Their Endocrine-behavior Relations |last1=Aronson |first1=L.

After mating, the female washes her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.&lt;ref name="compendium" /&gt;

Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.&lt;ref name="Wildt 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wildt |first1=D.

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name="Rochlitz" /&gt; The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Rochlitz" /&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large [[feral cat colony|colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name="hsus-feral"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archive-date=1 May 2008 |title=What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat? |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php |title=Torre Argentina cat shelter. |access-date=17 June 2009 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203413/http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php |archive-date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to regarding them as vermin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |isbn=978-0-9658942-7-2 |last1=Rowan |first1=Andrew N. |last2=Salem |first2=Deborah J. |title=The State of the Animals II: 2003 |date=November 2003 |chapter=4 |chapter-url= http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/hsp/SOA_3-2005_Chap4.pdf |format=PDF

Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.&lt;ref name="hsus-feral" /&gt;

Some of the same factors that have promoted [[adaptive radiation]] of island [[Bird|avifauna]] over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to non-native species in modern time.

===Cat show===
{{main|Cat show}}
A [[cat show]] is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/cat-show1.htm|title=All About Cat Shows|date=2 April 2008|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/cat-show.htm|title=All About Cat Shows|date=2 April 2008|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=8 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[pedigree (cat)|pedigreed]] and companion (or moggy) cats are admissible, although the rules differ from organization to organization.

Moggies are judged based on their temperament. Often, at the end of the year, all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded.

A [[cat café]] is a theme [[café]] whose attraction is cats that can be watched and played with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cat-cafe |title=cat café |website=Cambridge English Dictionary |access-date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ailurophobia===
{{main|Ailurophobia}}
[[Ailurophobia]] is a human [[phobia]] of cats; however, the term is often associated with humans that have a hatred of cats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/234/3.html Bartleby: Ailurophobes and Other Cat-Haters] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171223220422/http://www.bartleby.com/234/3.html |date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cat bites===
{{Main|Cat bite}}
Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive.

This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep [[wound|punctures]]. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps [[microorganisms]] that cause [[infection]].&lt;ref name=assh&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment |title=Animal Bites |publisher=[[American Society for Surgery of the Hand]] |date=2017 |work=HandCare.org |access-date=18 June 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170728015622/http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment |archive-date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kidshealth /&gt;

===Infections transmitted from cats to humans===
{{Main|Feline zoonosis}}

Cats can be [[infection|infected]] or infested with [[virus]]es, [[pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]], [[fungus]], [[protozoans]], [[arthropod]]s or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.&lt;ref name="Chomel2014" /&gt; In some cases, the cat exhibits no [[symptoms]] of the disease,&lt;ref name=Ohio2016&gt;{{cite web |title=Cats |publisher=[[Ohio Department of Health]] |url= http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats |access-date=26 November 2016 |date=21 January 2015 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161127023823/http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats |archive-date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same disease can then become evident in a human.  The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat [[feces]] and [[parasite]]s exiting the cat's body.&lt;ref name="Chomel2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomel |first=Bruno |title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats |journal=Animals |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=2014 |pages=434–445 |issn=2076-2615 |doi=10.3390/ani4030434 |pmid=26480316 |pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StullBrophy2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stull |first1=J.

====Superstitions and cat burning====
[[File:Close up of a black domestic cat.jpg|225px|right|thumb|Some cultures are superstitious about black cats, ascribing either good or bad luck to them.]]
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] "crossing one's path" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck?

According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people "shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |title=Europe: A History |date=1996 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-198-20171-7 |page=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people.

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives.

The '''llama''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɑː|m|ə}}; {{IPA-es|ˈʎama}}) (''Lama glama'') is a domesticated [[South America]]n [[camelid]], widely used as a [[List of meat animals|meat]] and [[pack animal]] by [[Inca empire|Andean cultures]] since the [[Pre-Columbian era]].

The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is {{convert|1.7|to|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between {{convert|130|and|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. At birth, a baby llama (called a ''[[cria]]'') can weigh between {{convert|9|and|14|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

They are very social animals and live with other llamas as a [[herd]]. The [[wool]] produced by a llama is very soft and [[lanolin]]-free. Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 [[kilometre|km]] (5–8 [[mile]]s).&lt;ref name=OK_State&gt;

The name ''llama'' (in the past also spelled 'lama' or 'glama') was adopted by [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlers]] from [[Indigenous people in Peru|native Peruvians]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, "''llama''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of [[North America]] about 40 million [[year]]s ago. They migrated to South America about three million years ago during the [[Great American Interchange]]. By the end of the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America.&lt;ref name=OK_State/&gt; As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and [[alpaca]]s in South America, and due to importation from South America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Numbers&gt;

== Classification ==
[[File:A Quechua girl and her Llama.jpg|thumb|A traditionally dressed [[Quechuas|Quechua]] girl with a llama in [[Cusco]], [[Peru]]]]

Lamoids, or llamas (as they are more generally known as a group), consist of the [[vicuña]] (''Vicugna vicugna'', prev. ''Lama vicugna''), [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), Suri [[alpaca]], and [[Huacaya alpaca]] (''Vicugna pacos'', prev. ''Lama guanicoe pacos''), and the domestic llama (''Lama glama''). Guanacos and vicuñas live in the wild, while alpacas – as well as llamas – exist only as domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wonders of Llamas|isbn=0-396-07460-X |first=Roger |last=Perry |year=1977 |publisher=Dodd, Mead &amp; Company |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although early writers compared llamas to [[sheep]], their similarity to the [[camel]] was soon recognized. They were included in the genus ''Camelus'' along with [[alpaca]] in the ''Systema Naturae'' ([[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]) of [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb9zbY-JfBUC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=0-8138-0397-7|title=Medicine and Surgery of South American Camelids|author=Murray E. Fowler|year=1998|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were, however, separated by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1800 under the name of ''lama'' along with the [[guanaco]].&lt;ref name=ITIS&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama|url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=624943#|publisher=Integrated Taxonomic Information System|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alpaca]]s and [[vicuña]]s are in genus ''Vicugna''. The genera ''Lama'' and ''Vicugna'' are, with the two species of true camels, the sole existing representatives of a very distinct section of the [[Artiodactyla]] or even-toed ungulates, called [[Tylopoda]], or "bump-footed", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet. The Tylopoda consist of a single family, the Camelidae, and shares the [[taxon|order]] Artiodactyla with the [[Suinae|Suina]] ([[pig]]s), the Tragulina ([[chevrotain]]s), the [[Pecora]] ([[ruminant]]s), and the [[Whippomorpha]] ([[Hippopotamidae|hippos]] and [[cetacea]]ns, which belong to Artiodactyla from a [[Cladistics|cladistic]], if not traditional, standpoint). The Tylopoda have more or less affinity to each of the sister [[taxon|taxa]], standing in some respects in a middle position between them, sharing some characteristics from each, but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
[[File:Domestic llama (2009-05-19).jpg|thumb|left|A domestic llama]]
The 19th-century discoveries of a vast and previously unexpected extinct [[Paleogene]] fauna of North America, as interpreted by paleontologists [[Joseph Leidy]], [[Edward Drinker Cope]], and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], aided understanding of the early history of this family.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Llamas were not always confined to [[South America]]; abundant llama-like remains were found in [[Pleistocene]] deposits in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in [[Central America]]. Some of the [[fossil]] llamas were much larger than current forms. Some species remained in North America during the last ice ages. North American llamas are categorized as a single extinct genus, ''[[Hemiauchenia]]''. Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000 years ago, in modern-day [[California]], [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], [[Missouri]], and [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=kurten&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurtén|first=Björn|title=Pleistocene Mammals of North America|year=1980|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231037333|author2=Anderson, Elaine |page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camelid lineage has a good fossil record. Camel-like animals have been traced from the thoroughly differentiated, modern species back through early [[Miocene]] forms. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} No fossils of these earlier forms have been found in the [[Old World]], indicating that North America was the original home of camelids, and that Old World [[camel]]s crossed over via the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]]. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part of the [[Great American Interchange]], where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American camelids [[Quaternary extinction event|died out at the end of the Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grayson |first1=Donald K. |year=1991 |title=Late Pleistocene mammalian extinctions in North America: Taxonomy, chronology, and explanations |journal=Journal of World Prehistory |volume= 5|issue=3 |pages=193–231 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |doi=10.1007/BF00974990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The following characteristics apply especially to llamas. [[Dentition]] of adults:-incisors 1/3 canines 1/1, premolars 2/2, molars 3/2; total 32. In the upper jaw, a compressed, sharp, pointed laniariform [[incisor]] near the hinder edge of the [[premaxilla]] is followed in the male at least by a moderate-sized, pointed, curved true [[canine tooth|canine]] in the anterior part of the maxilla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/pregastric/llamapage.html Colorado State University, Hypertexts for Biomedical Science: Dental Anatomy of Ruminants]&lt;/ref&gt; The isolated canine-like [[premolar]] that follows in the camels is not present. The teeth of the molar series, which are in contact with each other, consist of two very small premolars (the first almost rudimentary) and three broad [[molars]], constructed generally like those of ''Camelus''. In the lower jaw, the three incisors are long, spatulate, and procumbent; the outer ones are the smallest. Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars, which differ from those of ''Camelus'' in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge.

[[File:Black Llama.jpg|thumb|300px|Picture of a Black Llama]]

The skull generally resembles that of ''Camelus'', the larger brain-cavity and orbits and less-developed [[cranial ridges]] being due to its smaller size. The nasal bones are shorter and broader, and are joined by the premaxilla.

[[Vertebrae]]:
* cervical 7,
* dorsal 12,
* lumbar 7,
* sacral 4,
* caudal 15 to 20.

The ears are rather long and slightly curved inward, characteristically known as "banana" shaped. There is no dorsal hump. The feet are narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having a distinct plantar pad. The tail is short, and fibre is long, woolly and soft.

In essential structural characteristics, as well as in general appearance and habits, all the animals of this genus very closely resemble each other, so whether they should be considered as belonging to one, two, or more species is a matter of controversy among [[natural history|naturalists]].

The question is complicated by the circumstance of the great majority of individuals that have come under observation being either in a completely or partially domesticated state. Many are also descended from ancestors that have previously been domesticated, a state that tends to produce a certain amount of variation from the original type. The four forms commonly distinguished by the inhabitants of South America are recognized as distinct species, though with difficulties in defining their distinctive characteristics.

These are:
* the llama, ''Lama glama'' ([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]);
* the [[alpaca]], ''Vicugna pacos'' (Linnaeus);
* the [[guanaco]] (from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] ''huanaco''), ''Lama guanicoe'' ([[Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller|Müller]]); and
* the [[vicuña]], ''Vicugna vicugna'' ([[Juan Ignacio Molina|Molina]])

The llama and alpaca are only known in the domestic state, and are variable in size and of many colors, being often white, brown, or piebald. Some are grey or black. The guanaco and vicuña are wild, the former being endangered, and of a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below. They certainly differ from each other, the vicuña being smaller, more slender in its proportions, and having a shorter head than the guanaco. The vicuña lives in [[herd]]s on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout [[Peru]], in the southern part of [[Ecuador]], and as far south as the middle of [[Bolivia]]. Its manners very much resemble those of the [[chamois]] of the European [[Alps]]; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid. The fiber is extremely delicate and soft, and highly valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal.
Alpacas are descended from wild vicuna ancestors, while domesticated llamas are descended from wild guanaco ancestors, though a considerable amount of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between the two species has occurred.

Differential characteristics between llamas and alpacas include the llama's larger size, longer head, and curved ears. Alpaca fiber is generally more expensive, but not always more valuable. Alpacas tend to have a more consistent color throughout the body. The most apparent visual difference between llamas and [[camel]]s is that camels have a hump or humps and llamas do not.

Llamas are not ruminants, pseudo-ruminants, or modified ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;https://veteriankey.com/camelids-are-not-ruminants/&lt;/ref&gt; They have a complex stomach with several compartments that allows them to consume lower quality, high cellulose foods. The stomach compartments allow for fermentation of tough food stuffs, followed by regurgitation and re-chewing. Ruminants have four compartments (cows, sheep, goats), whereas llamas have only three stomach compartments: the rumen, omasum, and abomasum.

In addition, the llama (and other camelids) have an extremely long and complex large intestine (colon). The large intestine's role in digestion is to reabsorb water, vitamins and electrolytes from food waste that is passing through it. The length of the llama's colon allows it to survive on much less water than other animals. This is a major advantage in arid climates where they live.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Amsel (13 November 2017) “Llama Thoracic &amp; Abdominal Organs” https://www.exploringnature.org/db/view/Llama-Thoracic-and-Abdonimal-Organs-Right-View&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Emmett and evie.JPG|thumb|upright|Dam and her [[cria]]]]

Like humans, llama males and females mature sexually at different rates. Females reach puberty at about 12 months old; males do not become sexually mature until around three years of age.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Mating ===
Llamas mate with the female in a kush (lying down) position, which is fairly unusual in a large animal. They mate for an extended time (20–45 minutes), also unusual in a large animal.&lt;ref name=CebraAnderson2014&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chris Cebra |author2=David E.

=== Gestation ===
The gestation period of a llama is 11.5 months (350 days). Dams (female llamas) do not lick off their babies, as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more than half an inch ({{convert|0.5|in|cm|disp=out}}). Rather, they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Crias ===
A [[cria]] (from Spanish for "baby") is the name for a baby llama, [[alpaca]], [[vicuña]], or [[guanaco]]. Crias are typically born with all the females of the herd gathering around, in an attempt to protect against the male llamas and potential predators. Llamas give birth standing. Birth is usually quick and problem-free, over in less than 30 minutes. Most births take place between 8&amp;nbsp;am and noon, during the warmer daylight hours. This may increase cria survival by reducing fatalities due to [[hypothermia]] during cold Andean nights. This birthing pattern is speculated to be a continuation of the birthing patterns observed in the wild. Crias are up and standing, walking and attempting to suckle within the first hour after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= The Department of Veterninary Clinical Sciences at Ohio State University|title= Camelid Medicine, Surgery, and Reproduction for Veterinarians|series= Part II|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Long |first= Patrick O. |title= Llama &amp; Alpaca Neonatal Care|page= 112|isbn=0-9646618-3-7|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Birutta|first= Gale|title= A Guide to Raising Llamas| page= 327|isbn=0-88266-954-0|year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crias are partially fed with llama milk that is lower in fat and salt and higher in phosphorus and calcium than cow or goat milk. A female llama will only produce about {{convert|60|ml|impoz|abbr=on}} of milk at a time when she gives milk, so the cria must suckle frequently to receive the nutrients it requires.&lt;ref name=VETMED&gt;

=== Breeding methods ===
In '''harem mating''', the male is left with females most of the year.

For '''field mating''', a female is turned out into a field with a male llama and left there for some period of time. This is the easiest method in terms of labor, but the least useful in terms of prediction of a likely birth date. An ultrasound test can be performed, and together with the exposure dates, a better idea of when the cria is expected can be determined.

'''Hand mating''' is the most efficient method, but requires the most work on the part of the human involved. A male and female llama are put into the same pen and mating is monitored. They are then separated and remated every other day until one or the other refuses the mating. Usually, one can get in two matings using this method, though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once. The separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llama's reproductive tract more sound. If the mating is not successful within two to three weeks, the female is mated again.

=== Pregnancy ===
[[File:lamas in the sunset San Pedro de Atacama Chile Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|Llamas at [[San Pedro de Atacama]], [[Chile]]]]
{{Section howto|date=December 2016}}Llamas should be tested for pregnancy after mating at two to three, six and at least 12 weeks.
# For "spit" testing, bring the potentially pregnant dam to an intact male. If the stud attempts to mate with her and she lies down for him within a fairly short period of time, she is not pregnant. If she remains on her feet, spits, attacks him, or otherwise prevents his being able to mate, it is assumed she is probably pregnant. This test gets its name due to the dam spitting at the male if she is pregnant.
# For [[progesterone]] testing, a veterinarian can test a blood sample for progesterone. A high level can indicate a pregnancy.
# With palpation, the veterinarian or breeder manually feels inside the llama to detect a pregnancy. Some risks to the llama exist, but it can be an accurate method for pregnancy detection.
# Ultrasound is the most accurate method for an experienced veterinarian, who can do an exterior examination and detect a fetus as early as 45 days.

Spit testing with an intact male is generally free and is usually accurate. However, some hormonal conditions in females can make them reject a male when they are in fact not pregnant, and, more rarely, accept a male when they are pregnant. Progesterone tests can give a high reading in some females with a hormonal problem that are in fact not pregnant. Neither of the previous methods, nor palpation, can give a reasonably accurate idea of the age of the fetus, while an ultrasound procedure can. In addition, an ultrasound procedure can distinguish between pregnancy and misleading physical conditions, or between a live and dead fetus. The disadvantages of an ultrasound procedure are cost, some training in the use of ultrasound equipment is required, and not all veterinarians have the equipment needed to perform the examination.

== Nutrition ==
Options for feeding llamas are quite wide; a wide variety of commercial and farm-based feeds are available. The major determining factors include feed cost, availability, nutrient balance and energy density required. Young, actively growing llamas require a greater concentration of nutrients than mature animals because of their smaller digestive tract capacities.&lt;ref&gt;

== Behavior ==
[[File:Lloyd the Llama.jpg|thumb|A pack llama in the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]]]]
Llamas, which are well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after [[weaning]], are very friendly and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily. However, [[Berserk llama syndrome|llamas that are bottle-fed]] or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Llama farmers say beasts no burden|last=Britton|first=Rick|date=24 May 2001|work=Washington Times|access-date=|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When correctly reared, llamas spitting at a human is a rare thing. Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and do sometimes spit at each other as a way of disciplining lower-ranked llamas in the herd. A llama's social rank in a herd is never static. They can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights. This is usually done between males to see which will become dominant. Their fights are visually dramatic, with spitting, ramming each other with their chests, neck wrestling and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance. The females are usually only seen spitting as a means of controlling other herd members.

While the social structure might always be changing, they live as a family and they do take care of each other. If one notices a strange noise or feels threatened, a warning bray is sent out and all others become alert. They will often hum to each other as a form of communication.

The sound of the llama making groaning noises or going "mwa" (/mwaʰ/) is often a sign of fear or anger. If a llama is agitated, it will lay its ears back. One may determine how agitated the llama is by the materials in the spit. The more irritated the llama is, the further back into each of the three stomach compartments it will try to draw materials from for its spit.

An "orgle" is the mating sound of a llama or alpaca, made by the sexually aroused male. The sound is reminiscent of gargling, but with a more forceful, buzzing edge. Males begin the sound when they become aroused and continue throughout the act of procreation – from 15 minutes to more than an hour.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Guard behavior ===
{{Main|Guard llama}}
[[File:Llama guarding sheep.jpg|thumb|225px|Llama guarding sheep on the South Downs in [[West Sussex]]]]
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Lever-park-1910.png|thumb|Llama at [[Rivington]], Lancashire, ''circa'' 1912]] --&gt;
Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then.&lt;ref&gt;International Llama Association. (1995). "Guard Llamas." ILA Educational Brochure No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Geo"&gt;Walker, Cameron. "[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0610_030610_llamashepherds.html Guard Llamas Keep Sheep Safe From Coyotes.]" ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', 10 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; They are used most commonly in the western regions of the [[United States]], where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.

Research suggests the use of multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another, rather than with the livestock, and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas appear to bond more quickly to sheep or goats if they are introduced just prior to [[lambing]]. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.

Using llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year more than exceeds the purchase cost and annual maintenance of a llama. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whyllama.com/GuardLlamas.htm#Guarding%20behavior/ |title=Guard Llamas: An Alternative for Effective Predator Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}}

=== Pre-Incan cultures ===
Scholar Alex Chepstow-Lusty has argued that the switch from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to widespread [[agriculture]] was only possible because of the use of llama [[feces|dung]] as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;Anning, Caroline.

In the Inca empire, llamas were the only beasts of burden, and many of the people dominated by the Inca had long traditions of llama herding. For the Inca nobility, the llama was of symbolic significance, and llama figures were often buried with the dead.&lt;ref name=Inca_Culture&gt;

According to [[Juan Ignacio Molina]], the Dutch captain [[Joris van Spilbergen]] observed the use of [[chilihueque|hueques]] (possibly a llama type) by native [[Mapuche]]s of [[Mocha Island]] as [[plough|plow animals]] in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Bautista Ignacio Molina|title=The geographical, natural and civil history of Chili, tr. by an American gentleman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F4oIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=22 August 2011|year=1808|pages=15–16|volume =II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fiber ==
Llamas have a fine undercoat, which can be used for handicrafts and garments. The coarser outer guard hair is used for rugs, wall-hangings and lead ropes. The fiber comes in many different colors ranging from white or grey to reddish-brown, brown, dark brown and black.

The '''Bactrian camel''' (''Camelus bactrianus'') is a large, [[even-toed ungulate]] native to the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]]. The Bactrian camel has two humps on its back, in contrast to the single-humped [[dromedary]] camel.&lt;ref&gt;The [[mnemonic]] that allows one to remember the correct English word for each is: "Bactrian" begins with "B", and "Dromedary" begins with "D" – and "B" on its side has two humps, whilst "D" on its side has only one hump.&lt;/ref&gt; Its population of two million exists mainly in the [[Domestication|domesticated]] form.&lt;ref name=EDGE&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=8 |title= Bactrian Camel| website= EdgeofExistence.org| publisher= EDGE| year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their name comes from the ancient historical region of [[Bactria]].&lt;ref name="netindustries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1151/Camels-Old-world-camels.html|title=Camels – Old World Camels|publisher=Net Industries|work=Science Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The domesticated Bactrian camel has served as a [[pack animal]] in inner Asia since ancient times. With its tolerance for cold, drought, and high altitudes, it enabled the travel of [[Camel train|caravans]] on the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Potts  | first = Daniel  | title = Bactrian Camels and Bactrian-Dromedary Hybrids  | work = The Silk Road Foundation Newsletter  | publisher = The Silk Road Foundation  | date = June 2005  | url = http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol3num1/7_bactrian.php  | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of feral Bactrian camels still roam the [[Mangystau Province]] of southwest Kazakhstan and the [[Nubra Valley]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Concise History of Afghanistan in 25 Volumes: Volume 1|last=Alikuzai|first=Hamid Wahed|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2013|isbn=1-4907-1447-2|location=|pages=696–702|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Wild Bactrian camel]] is a separate species and is the only truly wild (as opposed to feral) species of camel in the world.

The Bactrian camel shares the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Camelus]]'' with the [[dromedary]] (''C. dromedarius'') and the [[wild Bactrian camel]] (''C. ferus''). The Bactrian camel belongs to the family [[Camelidae]].&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Artiodactyla | id = 14200112 | page = 645–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groves|first1=C.|last2=Grubb|first2=P.|authorlink1=Colin Groves|authorlink2=Peter Grubb (zoologist)|title=Ungulate Taxonomy|year=2011|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-1-4214-0093-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] was the first to [[species description|describe]] the species of ''Camelus'': in his 4th century BC ''[[History of Animals]]'' he identified the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Buffon|first1=C.|authorlink=Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|title=Natural History, General and Particular|date=1791|publisher=Alexander Strahan|page=121|location=London, UK|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/77169#page/135/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first1=W.|last2=Anthon|first2=C.|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|year=1870|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper and Brothers Publishers]]|location=New York, USA|edition=3rd|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bactrian camel was given its current binomial name ''Camelus bactrianus'' by Swedish zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1758 publication ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''.&lt;ref name=SN&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linnaeus|first1=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturæ Per Regna Tria Naturae|date=1758|publisher=Laurentius Salvius|location=Stockholm, Sweden|page=65|edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th]]|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Peng Cui (of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]) and colleagues carried out a [[phylogenetic]] study of the evolutionary relationships between the two [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]] of Camelidae: [[Camelini]] — consisting of the three ''Camelus'' species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a [[subspecies]] of the Bactrian camel) — and [[Lamini]] — consisting of the [[alpaca]] (''Vicugna pacos''), the [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe''), the [[llama]] (''L. glama'') and the [[vicuña]] (''V. vicugna''). The study revealed that the two tribes had [[genetic divergence|diverged]] 25 million years ago (early [[Miocene]]), notably earlier than what had been previously estimated from North American fossils. [[Speciation]] began first in Lamini as the alpaca came into existence 10 million years ago (late [[Pleistocene]]). Nearly two million years later, the Bactrian camel and the dromedary emerged as two independent species.&lt;ref name="cui2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cui|first1=P.|last2=Ji|first2=R.|last3=Ding|first3=F.|last4=Qi|first4=D.|last5=Gao|first5=H.|last6=Meng|first6=H.|last7=Yu|first7=J.|last8=Hu|first8=S.|last9=Zhang|first9=H.|title=A complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (''Camelus bactrianus ferus''): an evolutionary history of Camelidae|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2007|volume=8|issue=1|pages=241|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-8-241|url=http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-8-241|pmid=17640355|pmc=1939714}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bactrian camel and the dromedary often interbreed to produce [[fertility|fertile]] offspring. Where the ranges of the two species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Iran and Afghanistan, the [[phenotypic]] differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding between them. The fertility of their [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] has given rise to speculation that the Bactrian camel and the dromedary should be merged into a single species with two varieties.&lt;ref name="camel"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAP013.pdf|title=The Camel (''Camelus dromedarius''): A Bibliographical Review|last=Mukasa-Mugerwa|first=E.|publisher=[[International Livestock Centre for Africa]]|year=1981|location=Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|pages=1–147}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1994 analysis of the [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome b]] [[gene]] revealed that the species display 10.3% divergence in their [[DNA sequencing|sequences]].&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kadwell|first2=M.|last3=Wheeler|first3=J.C.|date=1994|title=Molecular evolution of the family Camelidae: a mitochondrial DNA study|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=256|issue=1345|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1994.0041|last1=Stanley|first1=H.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences from wild Bactrian camels ===
The [[wild Bactrian camel]] (''Camelus ferus'') was first described by [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]] in the late 19th century and has now been established as a distinct species from the Bactrian camel (''Camelus bactrianus)''.&lt;ref name= GStatus&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Burger| first1= P.| last2= Silbermayr| first2= K.| last3= Charruau| first3= P.| last4= Lipp| first4= L.| last5= Dulamtseren| first5= E.| last6= Yadmasuren| first6= A.| last7= Walzer| first7= C. |publisher= ''in press''| title= Genetic status of wild camels (''Camelus ferus'') in Mongolia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= GDiv2014&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Chuluunbat| first1= B.| last2= Charruau| first2= P.| last3= Silbermayr| first3= K.| last4= Khorloojav| first4= T. | last5= Burger| first5= P.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zoological opinion nowadays tends to favour the idea that ''C. bactrianus'' and ''C. dromedarius'' are descendants of two different subspecies of ''C. ferus'' (Peters and von den Driesch 1997: 652) and there is no evidence to suggest that the original range of ''C. ferus'' included those parts of Central Asia and Iran where some of the earliest Bactrian remains have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Potts (2004), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In particular, a population of wild Bactrian camel has been discovered to live within a part of the Gashun Gobi region of the [[Gobi Desert]]. This population is distinct from domesticated herds both in [[Genome|genetic makeup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Wild camels 'genetically unique'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8151000/8151804.stm |date= &lt;!- – 11:09 GMT --&gt; 22 July 2009|work= Earth News|publisher= BBC |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in behavior.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

As many as three regions in the genetic makeup are distinctly different from Bactrian camels, with up to a 3% difference in the base genetic code. However, with so few wild camels, what the natural genetic diversity within a population would have been is not clear.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Another difference is the ability of these wild camels to drink saltwater slush, although whether the camel can extract useful water from it is not yet certain. Domesticated camels are unable to drink such salty water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Wild Camel Protection Foundation| title = Wild Camels| accessdate = 7 December 2012| url = http://www.wildcamels.com/bactrian-camels/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus).JPG|thumb|left|240px|Detail of feet]]
The Bactrian camel is the largest mammal in its native range and is the largest living camel. Shoulder height is from {{convert|180|to|230|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, head-and-body length is {{convert|225|-|350|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, and the tail length is {{convert|35|-|55|cm|in|abbr=on}}. At the top of the humps, the average height is {{convert|213|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Body mass can range from {{convert|300|to|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with males often being much larger and heavier than females.&lt;ref name= EDGE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/camelus_bactrianus.html |title= Bactrian Camel| website= UltimateUngulate.com| date= | publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its long, wooly coat varies in colour from dark brown to sandy beige. A mane and beard of long hair occurs on the neck and throat, with hairs measuring up to {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The shaggy winter coat is shed extremely rapidly, with huge sections peeling off at once, appearing as if sloppily shorn. The two humps on the back are composed of fat (not water as is sometimes thought). The face is typical of a camelid, being long and somewhat triangular, with a split upper lip. The long eyelashes, along with the sealable nostrils, help to keep out dust in the frequent sandstorms which occur in their natural range. The two broad toes on each foot have undivided soles and are able to spread widely as an adaptation to walking on sand. The feet are very tough, as befits an animal of extreme environments.

== Natural habitat ==
These camels are migratory, and their habitat ranges from rocky mountain massifs to flat arid desert, stony plains, and sand dunes. Conditions are extremely harsh – vegetation is sparse, water sources are limited and temperatures are extreme, ranging from as low as −40&amp;nbsp;°C in winter to 40&amp;nbsp;°C in summer. The camels’ distribution is linked to the availability of water, with large groups congregating near rivers after rain or at the foot of the mountains, where water can be obtained from springs in the summer months, and in the form of snow during the winter.

== Life history ==
Bactrian camels are exceptionally adept at withstanding wide variations in temperature, ranging from freezing cold to blistering heat. They have a remarkable ability to go without water for months at a time, but when water is available they may drink up to 57 liters at once. When well fed, the humps are plump and erect, but as resources decline, the humps shrink and lean to the side. When moving faster than a [[Horse gait#walk|walking]] speed, they [[pacing (horse gait)|pace]], by stepping forwards with both legs on the same side (as opposed to [[trot]]ting, using alternate diagonals as done by most other quadrupeds). Speeds of up to {{Convert|65|kph}} have been recorded, but they rarely move this fast.  Bactrian camels are also said to be good swimmers. The sense of sight is well developed and the sense of smell is extremely good. The lifespan of Bactrian camels is estimated at up to 50 years, often 20 to 40 in captivity.

=== Diet ===
Bactrian camels are diurnal, sleeping in the open at night and foraging for food during the day. They are primarily herbivorous. With tough mouths that can withstand sharp objects such as thorns, they are able to eat plants that are dry, prickly, salty or bitter, and can ingest virtually any kind of vegetation. When other nutrient sources are not available, these camels may feed on carcasses, gnawing on bones, skin, or various different kinds of flesh. In more extreme conditions, they may eat any material they find, which has included rope, sandals, and even tents. Their ability to feed on a wide range of foods allows them to live in areas with sparse vegetation. The first time food is swallowed, it is not fully chewed. The partly masticated food (called cud) goes into the stomach and later is brought back up for further chewing.

Bactrian camels belong to a fairly small group of animals that regularly eat snow to provide their water needs. Any animals living above the snowline are obliged to do this, as snow and ice are the only forms of water during winter, and by doing so, their range is greatly enlarged. The [[latent heat]] of snow and ice is enormous compared with the [[heat capacity]] of water, demanding a large sacrifice in heat energy and forcing animals to eat only small amounts at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/beef/facts/09-065.pdf |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs |title=Replacing Water with Clean Snow for Ewes and Beef Cows |first1=C. |last1=Wand |first2=C. |last2=Richardson |number=09-065 AGDEX 424/433 |date=November 2009 |access-date=February 9, 2017 |website=OMAFRA.gov.on.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111550/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/beef/facts/09-065.pdf |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
Bactrian camels are [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]]&amp;nbsp;— they [[Ovulation|ovulate]] after insemination (insertion of semen into the [[vagina]]); the seminal plasma, not the [[spermatozoa]], induces ovulation. Ovulation occurs in 87% of females after insemination: 66% ovulate within 36 h and the rest by 48 h (the same as natural mating). The least amount of [[semen]] required to elicit ovulation is about 1.0 ml.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last-author-amp=yes|year=1985|title=Semen-induced ovulation in the bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/74/2/335.full.pdf |journal=J. Reprod. Fert.|volume=74|issue=2|pages=335–339|doi=10.1530/jrf.0.0740335|author=Chen, B.X.|author2=Yuen, Z.X.|author3=Pan, G.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males during mating time are often quite violent and may bite, spit, or attempt to sit on other male camels. The age of [[sexual maturity]] varies, but is usually reached at 3 to 5 years. Gestation lasts around 13 months. One or occasionally two calves are produced, and the female can give birth to a new calf every other year. Young Bactrian camels are [[precocial]], being able to stand and run shortly after birth, and are fairly large at an average birth weight of {{convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They are nursed for about 1.5 years. The young calf stays with its mother for three to five years, until it reaches sexual maturity, and often serves to help raise subsequent generations for those years. Wild camels sometimes breed with domesticated or feral camels.

== Relationship to humans ==
[[File:Bactrian.camel.twice.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Two Bactrian camels]]
The Bactrian camel is thought to have been domesticated (independent of the dromedary) sometime before 2500 BC in Northeast [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9018795 "camel"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2007. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online. accessed 11 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; or southwestern [[Turkestan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehatchreport.com/information/myths-about-camels.html Myths About Camels], ''The Hatch Report.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dromedary camel is believed to have been domesticated between 4000 BC and 2000 BC in [[Arabia]]. As pack animals, these ungulates are virtually unsurpassed, able to carry {{convert|170|-|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at a rate of 47&amp;nbsp;km (30 miles) per day, or 4&amp;nbsp;km/h (2&amp;nbsp;mph) over a period of four days. Furthermore, Bactrian camels are frequently ridden, especially in desertified areas. In ancient [[Sindh]], for example, Bactrian camels of two humps were initially used by the rich for riding. The camel was later brought to other areas such as Balochistan and Iran for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Rahimdad Khan Molai Shedai; Janat ul Sindh 3rd edition 1993; Sindhi Adbi Board Jamshoro,page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Bactrian camels have been the focus of artwork throughout history. For example, western foreigners from the [[Tarim Basin]] and elsewhere were depicted in [[:File:Westerner on a camel.jpg|numerous ceramic figurines]] of the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).

=== United States imports ===
Bactrian camels were imported to the US several times in the mid- to late 1800s, both by the US military and by merchants and miners, looking for pack animals sturdier and hardier than horses and mules. Although the camels met these needs, the [[United States Camel Corps]] was never considered much of a success. Having brought two shipments of fewer than 100 camels to the US, plans were made to import another 1,000, but the [[US Civil War]] interrupted this. Most surviving camels of these endeavors, both military and private, were merely turned loose to survive in the wild. As a result, small feral herds of Bactrian camels existed during the late 19th century in the southwest deserts of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Zentner experiment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertusa.com/animals/desert-camel-experiment.html|title=The Desert Camel Experiment|last=Zentner|first=Joe|publisher=DesertUSA.com and Digital West Media, Inc.|access-date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
* ''[[The Story of the Weeping Camel]]'' is a [[2003 in film|2003]] [[Mongolia]]n documentary/story about a family of nomadic shepherds trying to get a white calf accepted by his mother, which rejected him after a difficult birth.

The '''sugar glider'''  (''Petaurus breviceps'') is a small, [[omnivorous]], [[arboreal]], and [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] [[gliding possum]] belonging to the [[marsupial]] [[infraclass]]. The common name refers to its preference for sugary foods like [[plant sap|sap]] and [[nectar]] and its ability to [[Gliding flight|glide]] through the air, much like a [[flying squirrel]].&lt;ref name=dpiwtas /&gt; They have very similar habits and appearance to the flying squirrel, despite not being closely related—an example of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analogy: Squirrels and Sugar Gliders|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/analogy_02|work=Understanding Evolution|publisher=The University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]], ''Petaurus breviceps'', translates from [[Latin (language)|Latin]] as "short-headed rope-dancer", a reference to their [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] [[acrobatics]].&lt;ref name="Tasmania Online"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sugar Glider, Petaurus breviceps|url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=4883|publisher=Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, Tasmania Online|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugar glider is characterised by its gliding membrane, known as the [[patagium]], which extends from its forelegs to its hindlegs,&lt;ref name=Endo(1998)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Endo|first1=H|last2=Yokokawa|first2=K|last3=Kurohmaru|first3=M|last4=Hiyashi|first4=Y|title=Functional anatomy of gliding membrane muscles in the sugar glider (''Petaurus breviceps'')|journal=Annals of Anatomy|date=1998|volume=180|pages=93–96|doi=10.1016/S0940-9602(98)80149-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; one on each side of its body.  [[Gliding flight|Gliding]] serves as an efficient means of reaching food and evading predators.&lt;ref name="dpiwtas"/&gt; The animal is covered in soft, pale grey to light brown fur  which is [[countershaded]], being lighter in colour on its underside.
 
The sugar glider is [[Endemism|endemic]] to parts of mainland [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]] and certain [[Indonesia]]n islands; and it was [[Introduced species|introduced]] to [[Tasmania]],&lt;ref name=smith(73)/&gt; probably in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=Gunn(1846)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=R.C.|title=In Minutes of the Tasmanian Society, July 2, 1845|journal=Tasmania Journal|year=1846|volume=2|number=11|pages=458–459|url=https://www.nla.gov.au/ferguson/14400642/18460100/00020011/61-70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunn(1851)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=R.C.|title=On the introduction and naturalization of Petaurus sciureus in Tasmania|journal=Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Van Dieman's Land|year=1851|volume=1|pages=253–255|url=https://archive.org/stream/papersproceeding1184951roya#page/252/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular [[exotic pet]] but is prohibited in some regions, including parts of Australia and the United States.

==Taxonomy==
The genus ''[[Petaurus]]'' is believed to have originated during the early-mid [[Miocene]] period (18 to 24 million years ago), then dispersed from New Guinea to Australia where Australian ''Petaurus'' species diverged.&lt;ref name=Malekian(2010)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malekian |first1=M |last2=Cooper |first2=S |last3=Norman |first3=J |last4=Christidis |first4=L |last5=Carthew |first5=S |title=Molecular systematics and evolutionary origins of the genus "Petaurus" (Marsupialia: Petauridae) in Australia and New Guinea |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |date=2010 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=122–135 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.07.026 |pmid=19647084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest ''Petaurus'' species occurred in Australia 4.46 million years ago; and the sugar glider is the only ''Petaurus'' species [[endemic]] to both Australia and New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Malekian(2010) /&gt;

The species is divided into seven subspecies; three occur in Australia, four in New Guinea, although debate regarding current species delineation continues.&lt;ref name=Malekian2 /&gt; These seven subspecies are currently designated by small [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences such as colour and body size.&lt;ref name=Malekian(2010) /&gt;  However, genetic analysis using [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicates that the morphological subspecies may not represent genetically unique populations.&lt;ref name=Malekian2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malekian |first1=Mansoureh| last2=Cooper|first2=Steven J. B. |last3=Carthew |first3=Susan M. |title=Phylogeography of the Australian sugar glider (''Petaurus breviceps''): evidence for a new divergent lineage in eastern Australia |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |date=2010 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=165 |doi=10.1071/ZO10016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the current geographic distribution of sugar gliders, two genetically distinct populations in Australia may have arisen due to long term geographical isolation following drying of the Australian continent after the [[Pliocene]] and the uplift of the [[Great Dividing Range]],&lt;ref name=Malekian2 /&gt;  by a process known as [[allopatric speciation]].  One population is found in coastal [[New South Wales]] and southern [[Queensland]]; and the other is found in northern Queensland, inland and southern New South Wales, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=Malekian2 /&gt;

Further evidence is required to clarify if changes to the current taxonomic divisions are warranted; for example, subspecies ''P. b. biacensis'' is provisionally considered a separate species, [[Biak glider]] (''Petaurus biacensis'').{{refn|group=note|name=Biak}}

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Sugar Glider JCB.jpg|thumb|left|The ''longicaudatus'' (long tailed) subspecies attracted to sugar water on a tree in Crater Lakes National Park, Queensland. The gliding membrane is visible along its side.]]
Sugar gliders are found throughout the northern and eastern parts of mainland Australia, Tasmania, [[New Guinea]] and several associated isles, the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Louisiade Archipelago]], and certain isles of [[Indonesia]], [[Halmahera Island]]s of the [[North Maluku|North Moluccas]].&lt;ref name="Walker(2009)p190"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dickman, Ronald M. Nowak |author2=introduction by Christopher R.|title=Walker's marsupials of the world|year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801882222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RT9W1WkePYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Australian sugar glider fossils were found in a cave in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and are dated to 15,000 years ago, at the time of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.&lt;ref name=smith(73)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Meredith J.|title=Petaurus breviceps|journal=Mammalian Species|date=13 June 1973|issue=30|pages=1–5|doi=10.2307/3503785|jstor=3503785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facilitated introduction of the sugar glider to Tasmania in 1835&lt;ref name="Qld"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife – Sugar Glider|url=http://www.wildlife.org.au/wildlife/speciesprofile/mammals/gliders/sugar_glider.html|publisher=Wildlife Queensland|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is supported by the absence of skeletal remains in subfossil bone deposits and the lack of an [[Tasmanian languages|Aboriginal Tasmanian]] name for the animal.&lt;ref name="dpiwtas"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120828032345/http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/BHAN-53J8XS?open DPIPWE – Sugar Glider&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, sugar glider distribution corresponds with forests along the southern, eastern and northern coastlines, and extends to altitudes of 2000 m in the eastern ranges.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt;

The sugar glider occurs in [[sympatry]] with the [[squirrel glider]], [[mahogany glider]], and [[yellow-bellied glider]]; and their coexistence is permitted through [[niche partitioning]] where each species has different patterns of resource use.&lt;ref name=Jackson(2k)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Stephen M.|title=Habitat relationships of the mahogany glider, ''Petaurus gracilis'', and the sugar glider, ''Petaurus breviceps''|journal=Wildlife Research|date=2000|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39|doi=10.1071/WR98045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have a broad habitat niche, inhabiting [[rainforest]]s and [[Copra plantations in New Guinea|coconut plantations in New Guinea]]; and rainforests, wet or dry [[sclerophyll]] forest and acacia scrub in Australia; preferring habitats with ''[[Eucalypt]]'' and ''[[Acacia]]'' species. The main structural habitat requirements are a large number of stems within the canopy, and dense mid and upper canopy cover, likely to enable efficient movement through the canopy.&lt;ref name=Jackson(2k) /&gt;

Like all arboreal, nocturnal marsupials, sugar gliders are active at night, and shelter in tree hollows lined with leafy twigs during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wormington|first1=K|last2=Lamb|first2=D|last3=McCallum|first3=H|last4=Moolooney|first4=d|title=Habitat requirements for the conservation of arboreal marsupials in dry sclerophyll forests of southeast Queensland, Australia|journal=Forest Science|date=2002|volume=48|issue=2|pages=217–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The average [[home range]] of sugar gliders is {{convert|0.5|ha}}, and is largely related to the abundance of food sources;&lt;ref name=suckling1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suckling|first1=G.C|title=Population ecology of the sugar glider "Petaurus breviceps", in a system of fragmented habitats|journal=Australian Wildlife Research|date=1984|volume=11|pages=49–75|doi=10.1071/WR9840049}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Population density|density]] ranges from two to six individuals per hectare (0.8–2.4 per acre).

Native owls (''[[Ninox]]'' sp.)&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt; are their primary predators; others in their range include [[kookaburra]]s, [[goanna]]s, [[Snakes of Australia|snakes]], and [[quoll]]s.&lt;ref name="Qld"/&gt; [[Feral cat]]s (''[[Felis catus]]'') also represent a significant threat.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt;&lt;ref name=Qld /&gt;

==Appearance and anatomy==
[[File:Petaurus breviceps 1.jpg|thumb|left|This male's forehead bald spot is a scent gland. The eyes are adapted for night vision and the ears swivel.]]

Sexual dimorphism has likely evolved due to increased mate competition arising through social group structure; and is more pronounced in regions of higher latitude, where mate competition is greater due to increased food availability.&lt;ref name=Quin(1996)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quin|first1=DG|last2=Smith|first2=AP|last3=Norton|first3=TW|title=Eco-graphic variation in size and sexual dimorphism in sugar gliders and squirrel gliders (Marsupialia: Petauridae)|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|date=1996|volume=44|pages=19–45|doi=10.1071/ZO9960019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fur coat on the sugar glider is thick, soft, and is usually blue-grey; although some have been known to be yellow, tan or (rarely) [[Albinism in biology|albino]].{{efn|Domestic [[in-breeding]] of [[recessive gene]]tic [[phenotype]] defects can produce other colour variations not found in nature, such as an all-white [[leucistic]] [[heterozygote]]}} A black stripe is seen from its nose to midway on its back. Its belly, throat, and chest are cream in colour. Males have four [[scent gland]]s, located on the forehead, chest, and two paracloacal (associated with, but not part of the [[cloaca]] which is the common opening for the intestinal, urinal and genital tracts) that are used for marking of group members and territory.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt; Scent glands on the head and chest of males appear as bald spots. Females also have a paracloacal scent gland and a scent gland in the pouch, but do not have scent glands on the chest or forehead.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt;

The sugar glider is nocturnal; its large eyes help it to [[Rod vision|see at night]] and its ears swivel to help locate prey in the dark. The eyes are set far apart, allowing more precise [[triangulation]] from launching to landing locations while gliding.&lt;ref name=Jackson(1999)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=S. M.|title=Glide angle in the genus "Petaurus" and a review of gliding in mammals|journal=Mammal Review|date=1999|volume=30|pages=9–30|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2000.00056.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each foot on the sugar glider has five digits, with an opposable toe on each hind foot. These opposable toes are clawless, and bend such that they can touch all the other digits, like a human [[thumb]], allowing it to firmly grasp branches. The second and third digits of the hind foot are partially [[Syndactyly|syndactylous]] (fused together), forming a grooming comb.&lt;ref name="Hilltop"/&gt; The fourth digit of the forefoot is sharp and elongated, aiding in extraction of insects under the bark of trees.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt;

The gliding membrane extends from the outside of the fifth digit of each forefoot to the first digit of each hind foot. When the legs are stretched out, this membrane allows the sugar glider to glide a considerable distance. The membrane is supported by well developed tibiocarpalis, humerodorsalis and tibioabdominalis muscles, and its movement is controlled by these supporting muscles in conjunction with trunk, limb and tail movement.&lt;ref name=Endo(1998) /&gt;

Lifespan in the wild is up to 9 years; is typically up to 12 years in captivity,&lt;ref name="Tasmania Online" /&gt; and the maximum reported lifespan is 17.8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Magalhaes | first1 = J.

===Gliding===
The sugar glider is one of a number of volplane (gliding) possums in Australia. Gliders glide with the fore- and hind-limbs extended at right angles to their body, with their feet flexed upwards.&lt;ref name=Jackson(1999) /&gt; The animal launches itself from a tree, spreading its limbs to expose the gliding membranes. This creates an [[aerofoil]] enabling them to glide {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=off}} or more.&lt;ref name="Strahan-1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Strahan, the Australian Museum|editor=Ronald|title=Complete book of Australian mammals : the national photographic index of Australian wildlife|year=1983|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson|location=[Sidney]|isbn=0207144540|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every {{convert|1.82|m|abbr=on}} travelled horizontally when gliding, sugar gliders fall {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Jackson(1999) /&gt; Sugar gliders can steer by moving their limbs and adjusting the tension of their gliding membrane; for example, to turn left, a sugar glider will lower its left forearm below its right.&lt;ref name=Jackson(1999) /&gt;

This form of [[arboreal locomotion]] is typically used to travel from tree to tree; the species rarely descends to the ground.

===Torpor===
Sugar gliders can tolerate ambient air temperatures of up to {{convert|40|°C|°F}} through behavioural strategies such as licking their coat and exposing the wet area, as well as drinking small quantities of water.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt;
In cold weather, sugar gliders will huddle together to avoid heat loss, and will enter [[torpor]] to conserve energy.&lt;ref name=Kortner(2000) /&gt; Huddling as an energy conserving mechanism is not as efficient as torpor.&lt;ref name=Kortner(2000) /&gt; Before entering torpor, a sugar glider will reduce activity and body temperature normally in order to lower energy expenditure and avoid torpor.&lt;ref name="arjournals.annualreviews.org"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fritz |last=Geiser |title=Metabolic Rate and Body Temperature Reduction During Hibernation and Daily Torpor |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=239–274 |year=2004|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.66.032102.115105 |journal=Annual Review of Physiology |pmid=14977403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nereda |last=Christian |author2=Fritz Geiser  |title=To use or not to use torpor?

Torpor differs from [[hibernation]] in that torpor is usually a short-term daily cycle.

===Diet and nutrition===
Sugar gliders are seasonally adaptive omnivores with a wide variety of foods in their diet, and mainly forage in the lower layers of the forest canopy.&lt;ref name="Jackson(2k)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith87&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=AP |title=Diet and feeding strategies of the marsupial glider in temperate Australia |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=1982 |volume=51 |pages=149–166 |doi=10.2307/4316|jstor=4316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar gliders may obtain up to half their daily water intake through drinking rainwater, with the remainder obtained through water held in its food.&lt;ref name=Nagy(1985) /&gt; In summer they are primarily [[insectivorous]], and in the winter when insects (and other [[arthropod]]s) are scarce, they are mostly [[Exudate|exudativorous]] (feeding on [[acacia gum]], [[eucalyptus]] [[Plant sap|sap]], manna,{{efn| When dried, an [[exudate]] (such as sap) becomes [[Crystallization|crystallized]] and is referred to as ''[[manna]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=manna|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;s=manna&amp;i=1&amp;h=100#c|work=WordNet Search – 3.1|publisher=WordNet.

To obtain sap or gum from plants, sugar gliders will strip the bark off trees or open bore holes with their teeth to access stored liquid.&lt;ref name="smith87"/&gt; Little time is spent [[foraging]] for insects, as it is an energetically expensive process, and sugar gliders will wait until insects fly into their habitat, or stop to feed on flowers.&lt;ref name="smith87"/&gt;
Gliders consume approximately 11 g of dry food matter per day.&lt;ref name=Nagy(1985) /&gt; This equates to roughly 8% and 9.5% of body weight for males and females, respectively.

They are [[opportunistic feeder]]s and can be [[Carnivore|carnivorous]], preying mostly on lizards and small birds.

===Reproduction===

Like most [[marsupial]]s, female sugar gliders have two [[Ovary|ovaries]] and two [[Uterus|uteri]]; they are [[polyestrous]], meaning they can go into [[Estrus|heat]] several times a year.&lt;ref name=suckling1 /&gt; The female has a [[Pouch (marsupial)|marsupium]] (pouch) in the middle of her abdomen to carry offspring.&lt;ref name="Hilltop"/&gt; The pouch opens anteriorly, and two lateral pockets extend posteriorly when young are present. Four nipples are usually present in the pouch, although reports of individuals with two nipples have been recorded.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt; Male sugar gliders have a [[marsupial penis|bifurcated penis]] to correspond with the two uteri of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morges |first1=Michelle A. |last2=Grant |first2=Krystan R. |last3=MacPhail |first3=Catriona M. |last4=Johnston |first4=Matthew S. |title=A Novel Technique for Orchiectomy and Scrotal Ablation in the Sugar Glider (''Petaurus breviceps'') |journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine |date=March 2009 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=204–206 |doi=10.1638/2007-0169.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of sexual maturity in sugar gliders varies slightly between the males and females. Males reach maturity at 4 to 12 months of age, while females require from 8 to 12 months. In the wild, sugar gliders breed once or twice a year depending on the climate and habitat conditions, while they can breed multiple times a year in captivity as a result of consistent living conditions and proper diet.&lt;ref name="Hilltop"/&gt;

A sugar glider female gives birth to one (19%) or two (81%) babies (joeys) per litter.&lt;ref name=suckling1 /&gt; The gestation period is 15 to 17 days, after which the tiny joey {{convert|0.2|g|oz|abbr=on}} will crawl into a mother's pouch for further development. They are born largely undeveloped and furless, with only the [[olfaction|sense of smell]] being developed.  The mother has a scent gland in the external marsupium to attract the sightless joeys from the uterus.&lt;ref name = "Tynes(2010)"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tynes|editor1-first=Valarie V.|title=Behavior of exotic pets|date=2010|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Pub.]]|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=9780813800783|edition=1st|chapter=Sugar gliders}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joeys have a continuous arch of cartilage in their [[shoulder girdle]] which disappears soon after birth; this supports the forelimbs, assisting the climb into the pouch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Antinoff |first=Natalie |title=Practical anatomy and physical examination: Ferrets, rabbits, rodents, and other selected species (Proceedings) |url=http://veterinarycalendar.dvm360.com/avhc/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=638213&amp;sk=&amp;date=&amp;%0A%09%09%09&amp;pageID=5 |date=August 2009 |publisher=CVC in Kansas City Proceedings |accessdate=11 November 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724140555/http://veterinarycalendar.dvm360.com/avhc/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=638213&amp;sk=&amp;date=&amp;%0A%09%09%09&amp;pageID=5 |archivedate=24 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Young are completely contained in the pouch for 60 days after birth, wherein [[mammae]] provide nourishment during the remainder of development.&lt;ref name="Tynes(2010)"/&gt;  Eyes first open around 80 days after birth, and young will leave the nest around 110 days after birth.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt; By the time young are weaned, the [[Endotherm|thermoregulatory system]] is developed, and in conjunction with a large body size and thicker fur, they are able to regulate their own body temperature.&lt;ref name=holloway(2000)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holloway|first1=Joanne C.|last2=Geiser|first2=Fritz|title=Development of thermoregulation in the sugar glider Petaurus breviceps (Marsupialia: Petauridae)|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=November 2000|volume=252|issue=3|pages=389–397|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breeding is seasonal in southeast Australia, with young only born in winter and spring (June to November).&lt;ref name=suckling1 /&gt; Further north in [[Arnhem Land]], breeding is not seasonally restricted and young may be born throughout the year.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt;
Unlike animals that move along the ground, the sugar glider and other gliding species produce fewer, but heavier, offspring per litter.  This allows female sugar gliders to retain the ability to glide when pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fokidis|first1=H|last2=Risch|first2=T|title=The burden of motherhood: gliding locomotion in mammals influences maternal reproductive investment|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=2008|volume=89|issue=3|pages=617–625|doi=10.1644/07-MAMM-A-116R1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialisation===
Sugar gliders are highly social animals. They live in family groups or [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] consisting of up to seven adults, plus the current season's young. Up to four age classes may exist within each group, although some sugar gliders are solitary, not belonging to a group.&lt;ref name=suckling1 /&gt; They engage in [[social grooming]], which in addition to improving hygiene and health, helps bond the colony and establish group identity.

Within social communities, there are two codominant males who suppress subordinate males, but show no aggression towards each other. These co-dominant pairs are more related to each other than to subordinates within the group; and share food, nests, mates, and responsibility for scent marking of community members and territories.&lt;ref name=Klettenheimer1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klettenheimer|first1=B|last2=Temple-Smith|first2=P|last3=Sofrondis|first3=G|title=Father and son sugar gliders: more than a genetic coalition?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=1997|volume=242|issue=4|pages=741–750|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1997.tb05823.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Territory and members of the group are marked with saliva and a scent produced by separate glands on the forehead and chest. Intruders who lack the appropriate scent marking are expelled violently.&lt;ref name="dpiwtas"/&gt; Rank is established through scent marking; and fighting does not occur within groups, but does occur when communities come into contact with each other.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt; Within the colony, no fighting typically takes place beyond threatening behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Pasatta, J. (1999). [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Petaurus_breviceps/ "Petaurus breviceps" (On-line)], Animal Diversity Web. Accessed November 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Each colony defends a territory of about {{convert|1|hectare|acre}} where eucalyptus trees provide a [[staple food]] source.

Sugar gliders are one of the few species of [[mammal]]s that exhibit [[Paternal care|male parental care]].&lt;ref name=Goldingay(2010)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldingay|first1=R. L.|title=Direct male parental care observed in wild sugar gliders|journal=Australian Mammalogy|date=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=177–178|doi=10.1071/AM10009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest codominant male in a social community shows a high level of parental care, as he is the probable father of any offspring due to his social status.
This paternal care evolved in sugar gliders as young are more likely to survive when [[parental investment]] is provided by both parents.&lt;ref name=Goldingay(2010) /&gt; In the sugar glider, biparental care allows one adult to huddle with the young and prevent [[hypothermia]] while the other parent is out foraging, as young sugar gliders aren’t able to [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulate]] until they are 100 days old (3.5 months).&lt;ref name=Goldingay(2010) /&gt;

Communication in sugar gliders is achieved through vocalisations, visual signals and complex chemical odours.&lt;ref name=smith(73) /&gt; Chemical odours account for a large part of communication in sugar gliders, similar to many other nocturnal animals. Odours may be used to mark territory, convey health status of an individual, and mark rank of community members. Gliders produce a number of vocalisations including barking and hissing.

=== Conservation ===
The sugar glider is not considered [[endangered species|endangered]], and its conservation rank is "Least Concern (LC)" on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/16731/21959798|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss of natural habitat in Australia over the last 200 years, it is adaptable and capable of living in small patches of remnant bush, particularly if it does not have to cross large expanses of cleared land to reach them. However, several close relatives are endangered, particularly [[Leadbeater's possum]] and the [[mahogany glider]]. Sugar gliders may persist in areas that have undergone mild-moderate selective logging, as long as three to five hollow bearing trees are retained per [[hectare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wormington |first1=K. |last2=Lamb |first2=D. |last3=McCallum |first3=H. |last4=Moolooney |first4=d. |title=Habitat requirements for the conservation of arboreal marsupials in dry sclerophyll forests of southeast Queensland, Australia |journal=Forest Science |date=2002 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=217–227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not currently threatened by habitat loss, the ability of sugar gliders to forage and avoid predators successfully may be decreased in areas of high [[light pollution]].&lt;ref name=barber-m&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barber-Myer|first1=SM|title=Photopollution impacts on the nocturnal behaviour of the Sugar Glider (''Petaurus breviceps'')|journal=Pacific Conservation Biology|date=2007|volume=13|issue=3|pages=171–176|doi=10.1071/PC070171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation in Australia]] is enacted at the federal, state and local levels, where sugar gliders are protected as a native species. The central conservation law in Australia is the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act]] 1999 (EPBC Act).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/conservation/index.html#framework Biodiversity Conservation]. Environment.gov.au. Retrieved on 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974]] is an example of conservation law in the state of [[South Australia]], where it is legal to keep (only) one sugar glider without a permit, provided it was acquired legally from a source with a permit. A permit is required to obtain or possess more than one glider, or if one wants to sell or give away any glider in their possession. It is illegal to capture or sell wild sugar gliders without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/NATIONAL%20PARKS%20AND%20WILDLIFE%20ACT%201972.aspx South Australian Legislation].

===Introduction to Tasmania===

According to naturalist [[Ronald Campbell Gunn]], no ''Petaurus'' species is [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to Tasmania. He concluded that sugar gliders had been brought to [[Launceston, Tasmania]] as pets from Port Phillip, Australia (now [[Melbourne]]) soon after the founding of the port in 1834.  Some sugar gliders had escaped and quickly became established in the area.&lt;ref name=Gunn(1846)/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gunn(1851)/&gt; The species has been identified as a threat to the survival of the [[swift parrot]], which breeds only in Tasmania. Reduction in mature forest cover has left swift parrot nests highly vulnerable to predation by sugar gliders, and it is estimated that the parrot could be extinct by 2031.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-26/research-shows-swift-parrot-in-danger-of-extinction/6350564 "Tasmania's swift parrot in danger of extinction, calls to list the bird as critically endangered"], ABC News, 2015-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===In captivity===

In captivity, the sugar glider can suffer from [[calcium]] deficiencies if not fed an adequate diet. A lack of calcium in the diet causes the body to leach calcium from the bones, with the hind legs first to show noticeable dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hind Leg Paralysis|url=http://www.sugarglider.com/gliderpedia/index.asp?HindLegParalysis|publisher=SugarGlider.com|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium to [[phosphorus]] ratios should be 2:1 to prevent [[hypocalcemia]], sometimes known as hind leg paralysis (HLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cvex.2007.01.001| title = Emergency and Critical Care Procedures in Sugar Gliders (''Petaurus breviceps''), African Hedgehogs (''Atelerix albiventris''), and Prairie Dogs (''Cynomys'' spp.)| journal = Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice| volume = 10|pmid=17577562| issue = 2| pages = 533–55| year = 2007| last1 = Lennox | first1 = A.

Plenty of attention and [[Behavioral enrichment|environmental enrichment]] may be required for this highly social species, especially for those kept as individuals.

=== As a pet ===
[[File:Sugar Gliders eating Mealworms.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Male and Female Sugar Gliders eating mealworms from a bowl|[[Mealworms]] are a favourite food for some gliders kept as pets]]
Around the world, the sugar glider is popular as an [[exotic pet]], and is sometimes considered a [[pocket pet]].

In Australia, sugar gliders can be kept in Victoria, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. However, they are not allowed to be kept as pets in [[Western Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[the Australian Capital Territory]], [[Queensland]] or [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dixiglen.com.au/sugargliders.html |title=DixiGliders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlife.org.au/projects/gliders/image/qgn12.pdf Wildlife – Queensland Gliders]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2014-04-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar gliders are popular as pets in the United States, where they are bred in large numbers. Most states and cities allow sugar gliders as pets, with some exceptions including California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Illegal pets in California |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/nongame/nuis_exo/ferret/ferret_issues_table6.html |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Illegal pets in Hawaii |url=http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/news/2005/news-release-november-10-2005 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alaska]], and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/about/healthcode/health-code-article161.pdf New York City Health Code]. nyc.gov.

Nikhil Swaminathan. Accessed on 28 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[hunting dog|hunting]], [[herding dog|herding]], [[sled dog|pulling loads]], [[guard dog|protection]], [[police dog|assisting police]] and [[Dogs in warfare|military]], [[pet|companionship]] and, more recently, [[service dog|aiding handicapped individuals]] and [[Therapy dog|therapeutic]] roles. This influence on human society has given them the [[sobriquet]] "[[Man's best friend (phrase)|man's best friend]]".

==Terminology==
* The term ''dog'' typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.
* An adult female is a ''bitch''.
* An adult male capable of reproduction is a ''stud''.
* An adult female capable of reproduction is a ''brood bitch'', or ''brood mother''.
* Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are ''pups'' or ''puppies''.
* A group of pups from the same [[gestation period]] is a ''litter''.
* The father of a litter is a ''sire''. It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.
* The mother of a litter is a ''dam''.
* A group of any three or more adults is a ''pack''.

==Taxonomy==
In 1999, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey [[wolf]] populations, with the [[dingo]] and [[New Guinea singing dog]] "breeds" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other.&lt;ref name=wayne1999/&gt; In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist [[:de:W. Christopher Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under the wolf ''Canis lupus'' its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: "''familiaris'' Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]" and "''dingo'' Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]". Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' - the New Guinea singing dog - as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.&lt;ref name=wozencraft2005/&gt; The inclusion of ''familiaris'' and ''dingo'' under a "domestic dog" clade has been noted by other mammalogists.&lt;ref name=jackson2017/&gt; This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.&lt;ref name=smithC1/&gt;

==Origin==
{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}
&lt;!--Note: What is reflected in this section must be in accord with what is on the "Origin of the domestic dog" page and the "Gray wolf" page (sub-heading "Evolution and relationship with the dog"). Unless you have some subject knowledge on the topic, please don't tinker – if you are dog-kind then take your concerns to the "Origin of the domestic dog" Talk page, or wolf-kind take it to the "Gray wolf" Talk page&amp;nbsp;– all of your queries will be eventually answered.--&gt;

The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. It is known that the dog was the first domesticated species.&lt;ref name=larson2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=perri2016/&gt; The domestic dog is a member of the genus ''[[Canis]]'' (canines), which forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]],&lt;ref name=lindblad2005/&gt; and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fan2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thalmann2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vila1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The closest living relative of the dog is the [[gray wolf]] and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage.&lt;ref name="fan2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thalmann2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonholdt2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vila1997" /&gt; The dog and the [[Neontology|extant]] gray wolf form two sister [[clades]],&lt;ref name="vila1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="freedman2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="larson2014" /&gt; with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.&lt;ref name="freedman2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="larson2014" /&gt; The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago,&lt;ref name="giemsch2015" /&gt; with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="germonpre2009" /&gt;  These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human [[hunter-gatherers]] and not at the dawn of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedman2014/&gt;

Where the [[genetic divergence]] of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe,&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=thalmann2013/&gt; Central Asia,&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=shannon2015/&gt; and East Asia.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang2015/&gt; This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.&lt;ref name=machugh2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=frantz2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=grimm2016/&gt;

==Biology==
[[File:Dog anatomy lateral skeleton view.jpg|thumb|250px|Lateral view of skeleton]]

===Anatomy===
{{main|Dog anatomy}}
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt; Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt; Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

====Size and weight====
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a [[Yorkshire Terrier]], that stood only {{convert|6.3|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only {{convert|113|g}}. The largest known dog was an [[English Mastiff]] which weighed {{convert|155.6|kg|abbr=on}} and was {{convert|250|cm|abbr=on}} from the snout to the tail.&lt;ref name="zorba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldslargestdog1.com/zorba2/|title=World's Largest Dog|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest dog is a [[Great Dane]] that stands {{convert|106.7|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711133443/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |title=Guinness World Records – Tallest Dog Living |accessdate=7 January 2009 |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senses====
{{further|Dog anatomy#Senses}}

The [https://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/U/UNP-0066/UNP-0066.pdf dog's senses] include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep21848|pmid=26898837|pmc=4761878|title=Cryptochrome 1 in Retinal Cone Photoreceptors Suggests a Novel Functional Role in Mammals|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=21848|year=2016|last1=Nießner|first1=Christine|last2=Denzau|first2=Susanne|last3=Malkemper|first3=Erich Pascal|last4=Gross|first4=Julia Christina|last5=Burda|first5=Hynek|last6=Winklhofer|first6=Michael|last7=Peichl|first7=Leo|bibcode=2016NatSR...621848N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brain.mpg.de/news-events/news/news/archive/2016/february/article/magnetoreception-molecule-found-in-the-eyes-of-dogs-and-primates.html Magnetoreception molecule found in the eyes of dogs and primates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223085252/http://brain.mpg.de/news-events/news/news/archive/2016/february/article/magnetoreception-molecule-found-in-the-eyes-of-dogs-and-primates.html?tx_ttnews%5Bday%5D=22&amp;cHash=e29a96d380bf79d438733a01ec7bac82 |date=23 December 2016 }} MPI Brain Research, 22 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coat====
{{Main|Coat (dog)}}
[[File:Dog coat variation.png|thumb|Dogs display a wide variation on coat type, density, length, color, and composition]]

The [[pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or "single", with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,&lt;ref name="About.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.about.com/od/zoology12/f/countershading.htm|title=What is Counter Shading?|last= Klappenbach|first=Laura|year=2008|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Juliette|title=The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds|publisher=Paragon Publishing|year=2004|pages=20–23|chapter=Coat Types, Colours and Markings|isbn=0-7525-8276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding coat appearance or health, the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet, see [[Coat (dog)]] for more information.

====Tail====
{{See also|Docking (dog)|label 1=Docking}}
There are many different shapes for [[dog tail]]s: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally [[docking (dog)|docked]] to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/case4dock.htm|title=The Case for Tail Docking|publisher=Council of Docked Breeds|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some breeds, such as the [[Braque du Bourbonnais]], puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braquedubourbonnais.info/en/tail-genetics.htm |title=Bourbonnais pointer or 'short tail pointer' |publisher=Braquedubourbonnais.info |accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Differences from wolves====
[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Saarloos wolfdog]] carries more [[gray wolf]] DNA than any other dog breed&lt;ref name=skoglund2015/&gt;]]

Despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to inter-breed, there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel [[electrophoresis]] of red blood cell acid [[phosphatase]].&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, D. G., and M. Wong. 1972. Acid phosphatase, handy enzyme that separates the dog from the wolf. Acta Biologica et Medica Germanica 28:957–62&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Auditory bulla|tympanic bullae]] are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled.&lt;ref name="mech1974"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mech | first1 = D.

===Health===
{{Main|Dog health}}
There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs (and other mammals) including [[begonia]], [[Poinsettia]] and [[aloe vera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/plants-poisonous-to-dogs-00418000068562/|title=Plants poisonous to dogs – Sunset|work=Sunset}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow dysplasia|elbow]] and [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[blindness]], [[deafness]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis|pulmonic stenosis]], [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and [[luxating patella|trick knees]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[neutering|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mite]]s, as well as [[hookworms]], [[tapeworms]], [[roundworms]], and [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworms]].

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including [[chocolate|chocolate solids]] ([[theobromine poisoning]]), onion and [[garlic]] ([[thiosulphate]], [[sulfoxide]] or [[disulfide]] poisoning),&lt;ref&gt;Sources vary on which of these are considered the most significant toxic item.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grape]]s and [[raisin]]s, [[macadamia nut]]s, [[xylitol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = L.

Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fogle |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Fogle |year=1974 |title=Caring For Your Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are susceptible to [[theobromine poisoning]], typically from ingestion of [[chocolate]]. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that for some dogs even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including [[diabetes in dogs|diabetes]], dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogtime.com/diseases-shared-by-humans-pets-ernie-ward.html|title=Diseases shared by humans and pets|author=Ward, Ernie|publisher=Dogtime.com|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifespan====
{{Further|Aging in dogs}}
[[File:Terrier mixed-breed dog.jpg|thumb|left|Mixed-breed dogs such as this [[terrier]] have been found to run faster and live longer than their pure-bred parents (See [[Heterosis#Heterosis in dogs|heterosis]])]]

In 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D.

The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.&lt;ref name="KC Survey"&gt;

===Reproduction===
{{Main|Canine reproduction}}
[[File:Säugende Hündin.JPG|thumb|Dog nursing newborn puppies]]
In domestic dogs, [[puberty|sexual maturity]] begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&amp;nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first [[estrous cycle]]. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for [[pregnancy]]. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to [[Canine tying|copulation]].&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt; Because the [[ovum|ova]] survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for more than one male to sire the same litter.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt;

Fertilization typically occurs 2–5 days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days the heart beat is detectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11787146 |year=2001 |last1=Concannon |first1=P |last2=Tsutsui |first2=T |last3=Shille |first3=V |title=Embryo development, hormonal requirements and maternal responses during canine pregnancy |volume=57 |pages=169–79 |journal=Journal of Reproduction and Fertility.

Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after [[fertilization]],&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpvh.com/2011/07/27/gestation-in-dogs/ |title=Gestation in dogs |accessdate=24 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603145809/http://www.cpvh.com/2011/07/27/gestation-in-dogs/ |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six [[puppy|puppies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/overpopulation_estimates.html|title=HSUS Pet Overpopulation Estimates|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, [[toy dog]]s produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.

Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male [[French Bulldog]]s, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] in order to reproduce.&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726070030/http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|archivedate=26 July 2011|title=French Bulldog Pet Care Guide|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neutering====
[[File:Wilde huendin am stillen.jpg|right|thumb|A feral dog from [[Sri Lanka]] nursing very well-developed puppies]]

[[Neutering]] refers to the [[Neutering|sterilization]] of animals, usually by [[Castration|removal of the male's testicles]] or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce [[sex drive]]. Because of the [[overpopulation in companion animals|overpopulation of dogs]] in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter/ | title=Top 10 reasons to spay/neuter your pet | publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals | accessdate =16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], 3–4&amp;nbsp;million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|put down]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | quote = Although the cause of pet overpopulation is multifaceted, the lack of guardians choosing to spay or neuter their animals is a major contributing factor. | last = Mahlow | first = Jane C. | year = 1999 | title = Estimation of the proportions of dogs and cats that are surgically sterilized | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 215 | pages = 640–643 | pmid= 10476708 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other [[animal protection organizations]] urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.

===Inbreeding depression===

A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g. between half- and full siblings).&lt;ref name=Leroy&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroy G |title=Genetic diversity, inbreeding and breeding practices in dogs: results from pedigree analyses |journal=Vet.

In a study of seven breeds of dogs ([[Bernese mountain dog]], [[basset hound]], [[Cairn terrier]], [[Brittany (breed)|Epagneul Breton]], [[German Shepherd]] dog, [[Leonberger]], and [[West Highland white terrier]]) it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.&lt;ref name="pmid25475165"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroy G, Phocas F, Hedan B, Verrier E, Rognon X |title=Inbreeding impact on litter size and survival in selected canine breeds |journal=Vet.

==Intelligence, behavior and communication==

===Intelligence===
{{Main|Dog intelligence}}

Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with [[Rico (Border Collie)|Rico]] showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Dogs have advanced memory skills. A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, "Chaser", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands, although a 2018 study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are not more exceptional than those of other animals, such as [[horse]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s or [[cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/science/dog-smart-study.html|title=Your Dog May Be Smart, but She’s Not Exceptional|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs demonstrate a [[theory of mind]] by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian [[dingo]]s can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = B. | last2 = Litchfield | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = How well do dingoes (Canis dingo) perform on the detour task | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 155–162 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00263-X | pmid=12725735 | volume=13 | issue=9 | title=A simple reason for a big difference: wolves do not look back at humans, but dogs do | date=Apr 2003 | journal=Curr Biol | pages=763–6| author1=Miklósi | first1=A | last2=Kubinyi | first2=E | last3=Topál | first3=J | last4=Gácsi | first4=M | last5=Virányi | first5=Z | last6=Csányi | first6=V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them.&lt;ref name="hare2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-dogs-are-more-like-humans-than-wolves-22095590/?no-ist|title=Why Dogs are More Like Humans Than Wolves|author=Amy Crawford|work=Smithsonian|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavior===
{{Main|Dog behavior}}
{{see also|Dog behavior#Behavior compared with other canids}}
Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli.&lt;ref name=levitis2009/&gt; As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.&lt;ref name=berns2012/&gt; Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine
relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.&lt;ref name=tomasello2009/&gt;

Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Serpell J, Duffy D. Dog Breeds and Their Behavior. In: Domestic Dog Cognition and Behavior. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer; 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt; In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the [[Catecholamine#Synthesis|catecholamine synthesis]] pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response&lt;ref name=cagan2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Almada RC, Coimbra NC.

===Communication===
{{Main|Dog communication}}

Dog communication is about how dogs convey information to other dogs, how they understand messages from humans , and how humans translate the information that dogs are transmitting.&lt;ref&gt;Coren, Stanley "How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication" 2000 Simon &amp; Schuster, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xii}} Communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste). Humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body posture.

==Ecology==

===Population===
The global dog population is estimated at 900 million and rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gompper |first=Matthew E. |year=2013 |chapter=The dog–human–wildlife interface: assessing the scope of the problem |title=Free-Ranging Dogs and Wildlife Conservation |editor-last=Gompper |editor-first=Matthew E. |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0191810185 |pages=9–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt; Although it is said that the [[Man's best friend (phrase)|"dog is man's best friend"]],&lt;ref name="J.

Derbett London}}&lt;/ref&gt; this refers largely to the ~20% of dogs that live in developed countries. In the developing world dogs are more commonly feral, or village or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.&lt;ref name="DOGS"/&gt; Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ortolani|first = A|title = Ethiopian village dogs: Behavioural responses to a stranger's approach|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2009.03.011|volume=119|issue = 3–4|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|pages=210–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, stray or are in shelters, because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2009.00104.x| pmid = 19961472| title = What did domestication do to dogs?

===Competitors and Predators===
Although dogs are most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, the potential of feral and [[free-ranging dog]]s to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanak2014/&gt; Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt;{{sfn|Boitani|Mech|2003|p=259-264}}

Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together.{{sfn|Boitani|Mech|2003|p=305-306}} One study reported that in Wisconsin in 1999 more compensation had been paid for losses due to wolves taking dogs than for wolves taking livestock. In Wisconsin wolves will often kill hunting dogs, perhaps because they are in the wolf's territory.{{sfn|Boitani|Mech|2003|p=305-306}} A strategy has been reported from Russia where one wolf lures a dog into heavy brush where the another animal waits in ambush.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Graves, Will | url = http://www.wolvesinrussia.com/ | title = Wolves in Russia: Anxiety throughout the ages | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-55059-332-3 | publisher = Detselig Enterprises | location = Calgary | page = 222 | access-date = 13 June 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090802182158/http://www.wolvesinrussia.com/ | archive-date = 2 August 2009 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Interactions between wolves Canis lupus and dogs C. familiaris in Finland|publisher=Nordic Council for Wildlife Research |author1=Kojola, I. |author2=Ronkainen, S. |author3=Hakala, A. |author4=Heikkinen, S. |author5=Kokko, S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves has lead to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.&lt;ref name=lescureaux2014/&gt;

[[Coyote]]s and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. [[Leopard]]s in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of their size.&lt;ref name="Leopard"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Scott, Jonathan  |author2=Scott, Angela |title = Big Cat Diary: Leopard|year = 2006|isbn = 0-00-721181-3|publisher=Collins|location = London|page = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tiger]]s in [[Manchuria]], [[Indochina]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Malaysia]] are also reported to kill dogs.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Perry, Richard|title = The World of the Tiger|year = 1965|id = ASIN: B0007DU2IU|page = 260}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Striped hyena]]s are known to kill dogs in [[Turkmenistan]], [[India]], and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="Striped"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hyaena.ge/striped.htm|title = Striped Hyaena ''Hyaena (Hyaena) hyaena'' (Linnaeus, 1758)|publisher=IUCN Species Survival Commission Hyaenidae Specialist Group|accessdate =21 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928225108/http://www.hyaena.ge/striped.htm| archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs can healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet, and some sources do not recommend all-meat diets for dogs, due to their lack of calcium and iron.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt; Compared to wolves, dogs have genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.&lt;ref name="axelssonetal2013"/&gt;

===Range===
As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies. Notable exceptions once included:
* [[Aboriginal Tasmanians]], who were separated from Australia before the arrival of [[dingos]] on that continent
* The [[Andamanese]], who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar
* The [[Fuegians|natives of Tierra del Fuego]], who instead domesticated the [[Fuegian dog]], a different canid species
* Certain Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably: [[Palau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborne |first=Douglas |date=1966 |title=The archaeology of the Palau Islands |series=Bernice P.

==Breeds==
{{main|Dog breed}}

[[File:Big and little dog.jpg|thumb|Different dog breeds show a range of [[Phenotype|phenotypic variation]]]]

The domestic dog is the first species, and the only large [[carnivore]], known to have been domesticated. Especially over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern [[dog breeds]] due to [[artificial selection]] by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. Phenotypic variation can include height measured to the [[withers]] ranging from {{convert|15.2|cm}} in the [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] to {{convert|76|cm|abbr=on}} in the [[Irish Wolfhound]]; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; [[coat (dog)|coats]] can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.&lt;ref name="The Complete Dog"/&gt; The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were domesticated from shared ancestors of modern wolves, however the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog–wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.&lt;ref name=freedman2017/&gt;

==Roles with humans==
[[File:Gunnar Kaasen with Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gunnar Kaasen]] and [[Balto]], the lead dog on the last relay team of the [[1925 serum run to Nome]]]]

Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as [[bite inhibition]], from their wolf ancestors, which would have been [[pack hunter]]s with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.&lt;ref name="Miklósi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miklósi, Adám |title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KnVEIrVNGhIC|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929585-2|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages95-136}}

The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[hunting dog|hunting]], [[herding dog|herding]], [[sled dog|pulling loads]], [[guard dog|protection]], [[police dog|assisting police]] and [[Dogs in warfare|military]], [[pet|companionship]], and, more recently, [[service dog|aiding handicapped individuals]]. This influence on human society has given them the nickname "[[Man's best friend (phrase)|man's best friend]]" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs [[#As food|are also a source of meat]].&lt;ref name="Wingfield-Hayes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vietnam's dog meat tradition"/&gt;

===Early roles===
Wolves, and their dog descendants, likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.&lt;ref name="Groves"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Groves |first= Colin |year= 1999|title= The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being Domesticated | journal=Perspectives in Human Biology|volume = 4| pages = 1–12 | issn = 1038-5762}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt; Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and [[control of fire|controlling fire]] for a range of purposes.&lt;ref name=Groves/&gt;

Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.&lt;ref name="Tacon"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Paul |last1=Tacon |first2=Colin |last2=Pardoe |year=2002 |title=Dogs make us human |journal=Nature Australia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=52–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.&lt;ref name="Tacon"/&gt; Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.&lt;ref name="Tacon"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt.&lt;ref name="Tacon"/&gt; The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.&lt;ref name="Ruusila"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Vesa |last1=Ruusila |first2=Mauri |last2=Pesonen|year=2004 |title=Interspecific cooperation in human (''Homo sapiens'') hunting: the benefits of a barking dog (''Canis familiaris'') |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=545–9 |url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf41/anzf41-545.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.&lt;ref name="Newby"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Newby |first= Jonica |title= The Pact for Survival |publisher=ABC Books |location= Sydney |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7333-0581-4}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human emigrants from [[Siberia]] that came across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] into North America likely had dogs in their company. Although one writer&lt;ref name="Early Americas 1998"&gt;''A History of Dogs in the Early Americas'', Marion Schwartz, 1998, 260 p., {{ISBN|978-0-300-07519-9}}, Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; even suggests that the use of [[sled dogs]] may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago,&lt;ref name="Early Americas 1998"/&gt; the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago.&lt;ref name="Miklósi"/&gt;{{rp|104}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umaine.edu/news/blog/2011/01/11/umaine-student-finds-oldest-known-domesticated-dog-in-americas/ |title=The University of Maine – UMaine News – UMaine Student Finds Oldest Known Domesticated Dog in Americas |publisher=Umaine.edu |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were an important part of life for the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]] population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs as [[pack animal]]s  may have contributed migration of the [[Apache]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribes 1,400 years ago. This use of dogs in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the [[horse]] to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dogs history of America|author=Derr, Mark |year=2004|publisher=North Point Press}} p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt; The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt;

The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family,&lt;ref name="Power" /&gt; although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack.&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt; A [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] model of dog–human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program ''[[Dog Whisperer]]''.

Increasingly, human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as [[Musical canine freestyle|dog dancing]] and [[Doga (Dog Yoga)|dog yoga]].&lt;ref name="Nast"/&gt;

According to statistics published by the [[American Pet Products Manufacturers Association]] in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5&amp;nbsp;million people with pet dogs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html| title=U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are ongoing to promote [[pet adoption]], less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.

The latest study using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) comparing humans and dogs showed that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/10653182/Dogs-and-humans-respond-to-voices-in-same-way.html |title=Dogs and humans respond to voices in same way |author=James Edgar |date=21 February 2014 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports and shows===
{{See also|Conformation show}}

People often enter their dogs in competitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm|title=A Beginner's Guide to Dog Shows|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as breed-conformation shows or [[list of dog sports|sports]], including racing, sledding and agility competitions.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the ''[[nureongi]]'' (누렁이), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.&lt;ref name="pettid"&gt;Pettid, Michael J., Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 25. {{ISBN|1-86189-348-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular Korean dog dish is ''[[bosintang|gaejang-guk]]'' (also called ''bosintang''), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. Followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's ''[[Qi|gi]]'', or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with [[scallion]]s and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.&lt;ref name="pettid"/&gt;

===Health benefits for humans===
[[File:Puppy near Coltani - 17 apr 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=Small dog laying between the hands|[[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]] puppy being cuddled]]
The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Pet ownership and human health: a brief review of evidence and issues"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7527.1252 |title=Pet ownership and human health: A brief review of evidence and issues |year=2005 |last1=McNicholas |first1=June |journal=BMJ |volume=331 |issue=7527 |pages=1252–4 |pmid=16308387 |last2=Gilbey |first2=Andrew |last3=Rennie |first3=Ann |last4=Ahmedzai |first4=Sam |last5=Dono |first5=Jo-Ann |last6=Ormerod |first6=Elizabeth |pmc=1289326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Podberscek |first= A.L. |year= 2006|title=Positive and Negative Aspects of Our Relationship with Companion Animals |journal=Veterinary Research Communications |volume= 30|issue=1 |pages=21–27 |doi=10.1007/s11259-006-0005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been criticised for being poorly controlled,&lt;ref name="Health effects of ownership of and attachment to companion animals in an older population"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10705500802365532 |title=Health effects of ownership of and attachment to companion animals in an older population |year=2008 |last1=Winefield |first1=Helen R. |last2=Black |first2=Anne |last3=Chur-Hansen |first3=Anna |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Medicine |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=303–10 |pmid=19005930}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finding that "[t]he health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Headey B.|year = 1999|title = Health benefits and health cost savings due to pets: preliminary estimates from an Australian national survey|journal=Social Indicators Research|volume = 47|pages = 233–243|doi = 10.1023/A:1006892908532| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets."&lt;ref name="Pet ownership and human health: a brief review of evidence and issues"/&gt; In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.&lt;ref name="autogenerated717"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Serpell J |title=Beneficial effects of pet ownership on some aspects of human health and behaviour |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=84 |issue=12 |pages=717–20 |year=1991 |pmid=1774745 |pmc=1295517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-term.&lt;ref name="autogenerated717"/&gt; Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Friedmann E, Thomas SA |title=Pet ownership, social support, and one-year survival after acute myocardial infarction in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) |journal=The American Journal of Cardiology |volume=76 |issue=17 |pages=1213–7 |year=1995 |pmid=7502998 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(99)80343-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00005053-199108000-00006 |author=Wilson CC |title=The pet as an anxiolytic intervention |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=179 |issue=8 |pages=482–9 |year=1991 |pmid=1856711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=McNicholas |first1=J. |last2=Collis |first2=G.

In [[Christianity]], dogs represent faithfulness.&lt;ref name="Sherman2008"/&gt; Within the [[Roman Catholic]] denomination specifically, the iconography of [[Saint Dominic]] includes a dog, after the hallow's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="CP2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://churchpop.com/2017/08/07/hounds-of-the-lord-the-little-known-meaning-of-the-dominican-dog/|title="Hounds of the Lord": The Little-Known Meaning of the Dominican Dog|date=7 August 2017|publisher=ChurchPOP|language=English|accessdate=9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the [[Dominican Order]] ([[Ecclesiastical Latin]]: ''Dominicanus'') means "dogs of the Lord" of "hounds of the Lord" (Ecclesiastical Latin: ''domini canis'').&lt;ref name="CP2017"/&gt; In Christian folklore, a [[church grim]] often takes the form of a black dog to guard Christian churches and their [[churchyard]]s from [[sacrilege]].&lt;ref name="Dyer1898"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Thomas Firminger Thiselton|title=The Ghost World|year=1898|publisher=Ward &amp; Downey|language=English|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
{{Main|Cultural depictions of dogs in Western art}}
{{commons category|Dogs in art}}
Cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Koi'''|[[:ja:鯉|鯉]] || {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|k|ɔɪ}}, {{IPA-ja|koꜜi|lang}}}} or more specifically {{Nihongo|'''''nishikigoi'''''|[[:ja:錦鯉|錦鯉]] | extra={{IPA-ja|ɲiɕi̥kiꜜɡoi|}}, literally "[[brocade]]d carp"}}, are colored varieties of [[Cyprinus carpio|Common carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio'') that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor [[koi pond]]s or [[water garden]]s.

Koi is an informal group of the colored variants of the [[Cyprinus carpio]]. Several varieties are recognized by the Japanese. Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, and cream. The most popular category of koi is the ''Gosanke'', which is made up of the [[Kohaku (Nishikigoi)|''Kohaku'']], ''Taisho Sanshoku'', and ''Showa Sanshoku'' varieties.

== History ==
[[Carp]] are a large group of fish originally found in [[Central Europe]] and [[Asia]]. [[Asian carps|Various carp species]] were originally [[domestication|domesticated]] in [[East Asia]], where they were used as food fish. Carp are [[coldwater fish]], and their ability to survive and adapt to many climates and water conditions allowed the domesticated species to be propagated to many new locations, including Japan. Natural color mutations of these carp would have occurred across all populations. Carp were first bred for color mutations in [[China]] more than a thousand years ago, where [[selective breeding]] of the [[Prussian carp]] (''Carassius gibelio'') led to the development of the [[goldfish]].&lt;ref name="bristol"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/goldfish/info/info.htm |title=Background information about goldfish |accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amur carp (''[[Cyprinus rubrofuscus]]''), a member of the Cyprinid family [[species complex]] native to [[East Asia]], was [[aquaculture]]d as a food fish at least as long ago as the fifth century BC in China, and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (fourth century AD) texts mentioned carp with various colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genome Mapping and Genomics in Fishes and Aquatic Animals |publisher=Springer |page=47 |isbn=978-3-540-73837-4 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="genimpact.imr.no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genimpact.imr.no/__data/page/7650/common_carp.pdf |title=Common carp – ''Cyprinus carpio'' |author1=Flajšhans, M. |author2=Hulata, G. |accessdate=29 July 2010 |work=genimpact.imr.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amur carp was previously recognized as a sub-species of the common carp (as ''C. c. haematopterus''), but recent authorities treat it as a separate species under the name ''C. rubrofuscus''.&lt;ref name="IUCN carpio" /&gt;

Koi carp were first bred for color in Japan in the 1820s, initially in the town of Ojiya in the [[Niigata Prefecture]] on the northeastern coast of [[Honshu]] island. The outside world was unaware of the development of color variations in Japanese koi until 1914, when the Niigata koi were exhibited at an annual exposition in [[Tokyo]]. From that time, interest in koi spread throughout Japan. From this original handful of koi, all other Nishikigoi varieties were bred, with the exception of the Ogon variety (single-colored, metallic koi) which was developed relatively recently. The hobby of keeping koi eventually spread worldwide.

=== Etymology ===
The word "koi" comes from [[Japanese language|Japanese]], simply meaning "carp". It includes both the dull grey fish and the brightly colored varieties. What are known as koi in English are referred to more specifically as ''nishikigoi'' in Japan (meaning "[[brocade (weaving)|brocaded]] carp"). In Japanese, ''koi'' is a [[homophone]] for another word that means "affection" or "love"; koi are therefore symbols of love and friendship in Japan.

== Taxonomy ==
In the past, it was commonly believed that koi were bred from the [[common carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio''). Extensive [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between different populations, coupled with widespread translocations, have muddled the historical [[zoogeography]] of the common carp and [[Cyprinus|its relatives]]. Traditionally, Amur carp (''[[Cyprinus rubrofuscus]]'') were considered a subspecies of the common carp, often under the scientific name ''C. carpio haematopterus''. However, they differ in [[meristics]] from the common carp of Europe and Western Asia,&lt;ref name="IUCN carpio"&gt;{{IUCN | id = 6181 | taxon = ''Cyprinus carpio'' | assessor = Freyhof, J. | assessor2 = Kottelat, M. | last-assessor-amp = yes | assessment_year = 2008 | version = 2013.2 | accessdate = 6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading recent authorities to recognize them as a separate species, ''[[Cyprinus rubrofuscus|C. rubrofuscus]]'' (''C. c. haematopterus'' being a [[junior synonym]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{IUCN | id = 166052 | taxon = ''Cyprinus rubrofuscus'' | assessor = Allen, D. | assessor2 = Freyhof, J. | last-assessor-amp = yes | assessment_year = 2012 | version = 2016.2 | accessdate = 7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase | genus = Cyprinus | species = rubrofuscus | id=59920 | month = November | year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although one study of [[mitochondrial DNA]]  (mtDNA) in koi was unable to find a clear genetic structure matching the geographic populations (possibly because of translocation of carp from separate regions),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Discovery of an ancient lineage of ''Cyprinus carpio'' from Lake Biwa, central Japan, based on mtDNA sequence data, with reference to possible multiple origins of koi |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=66 |issue=6 |pages=1516 |doi=10.1111/j.0022-1112.2005.00676.x |year=2005 |last1=Mabuchi |first1=K. |last2=Senou |first2=H. |last3=Suzuki |first3=T. |last4=Nishida |first4=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; others based on mtDNA, [[microsatellite]] DNA and [[genomic DNA]] found a clear separation between the European/West Asian population and the East Asian population, with koi belonging in the latter.&lt;ref name="Grossa"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grossa |first=Riho |author2=Klaus Kohlmannb |author3=Petra Kerstenb |last-author-amp=yes |date=2002 |title=PCR–RFLP analysis of the mitochondrial ND-3/4 and ND-5/6 gene polymorphisms in the European and East Asian subspecies of common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'' L.) |journal=Aquaculture |publisher=Elsevier |volume=204 |issue=3–4 |pages=507–516 |doi=10.1016/S0044-8486(01)00836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chistiakov"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic evolution and diversity of common carp ''Cyprinus carpio'' L. |journal=Central European Journal of Biology |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=304–312 |doi=10.2478/s11535-009-0024-2 |year=2009 |last1=Chistiakov |first1=D.A. |last2=Voronova |first2=N.V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xu2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genome sequence and genetic diversity of the common carp, ''Cyprinus carpio'' |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=46 |pages=1212–1219 |doi=10.1038/ng.3098 |year=2014 |last1=Xu |first1=P. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, recent authorities have suggested that the ancestral species of the koi is ''C. rubrofuscus'' ([[syn.]] ''C. c. haematopterus'') or at least an East Asian carp species instead of ''C. carpio''.&lt;ref name="IUCN carpio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Freshwater Fisheries Ecology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |page=297 |isbn=978-1-118-39442-7 |year=2015 |last1=Craig |first1=J.F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] review of ''[[Cyprinus]]'' carp from eastern and southeastern Asia may be necessary, as the genetic variations do not fully match the currently recognized species pattern,&lt;ref name="Chistiakov" /&gt; with one study of mtDNA suggesting that koi are close to the Southeast Asian carp, but not necessarily the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Using mitochondrial nucleotide sequences to investigate diversity and genealogical relationships within common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'' L.) |journal=Anim.Genet. |volume=1 |pages=22–28 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2004.01215.x |year=2005 |last1=Thai |first1=B.T. |last2=Burridge |first2=C.P. |last3=Pham |first3=T.A. |last4=Austin |first4=C.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
[[File:Koi feeding, National Arboretum.jpg|thumb|right|Feeding the koi]]
Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, yellow, blue, and cream. While the possible colors are virtually limitless, breeders have identified and named a number of specific categories. The most notable category is ''Gosanke'', which is made up of the ''Kohaku'', ''Taisho Sanshoku'', and ''Showa Sanshoku'' varieties.

New koi varieties are still being actively developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitchkoi.co.uk/koikeepingtips/koi-varieties/ |title=Guide to Koi Varieties |work=mitchkoi.co.uk |accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost koi developed in the 1980s have become very popular in the [[United Kingdom]]; they are a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of wild carp and Ogon koi, and are distinguished by their metallic scales. [[Butterfly koi]] (also known as longfin koi, or dragon carp), also developed in the 1980s, are notable for their long and flowing fins. They are hybrids of koi with [[Asian carp]]. Butterfly koi and ghost koi are considered by some to be not true ''nishikigoi''.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

* {{Nihongo|''[[Kohaku (Nishikigoi)|Kōhaku]]''|紅白}} is a white-skinned koi, with large red markings on the top. The name means "red and white"; ''kohaku'' was the first ornamental variety to be established in Japan (late 19th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Tamadachi M |chapter=Koi varieties |page=191 |title=The Cult of the Koi |publisher=TFH Publications |location=Neptune City, New Jersey |year=1990 |isbn=0-86622-085-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Nihongo|''Taishō Sanshoku'' (or ''Taishō Sanke)''|大正三色}} is very similar to the ''kohaku'', except for the addition of small black markings called {{Nihongo|''sumi''|墨}}. This variety was first exhibited in 1914 by the koi breeder [[Gonzo Hiroi]], during the reign of the [[Taishō Emperor]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In the United States, the name is often abbreviated to just "Sanke". The ''kanji'', 三色, may be read as either ''sanshoku'' or as ''sanke'' (from its earlier name 三毛).
* {{Nihongo|''Shōwa Sanshoku'' (or ''Showa Sanke'')|昭和三色}} is a black koi with red (''hi'' 緋) and white (''shiroji'' 白地) markings. The first ''Showa Sanke'' was exhibited in 1927, during the reign of the [[Shōwa Emperor]]. In America, the name is often abbreviated to just "Showa". The amount of ''shiroji'' on ''Showa Sanke'' has increased in modern times (''Kindai Showa'' 近代昭和), to the point that it can be difficult to distinguish from ''Taisho Sanke''. The ''kanji'', 三色, may be read as either ''sanshoku'' or as ''sanke.''
* {{Nihongo|''Tanchō''|丹頂}} is any koi with a solitary red patch on its head. The fish may be a ''Tanchō Shōwa'', ''Tanchō Sanke'', or even ''Tanchō Goshiki''. It is named for the Japanese [[red-crowned crane]] (''Grus japonensis''), which also has a red spot on its head.
* {{Nihongo|''Chagoi''|茶鯉}}, "tea-colored", this koi can range in color from pale olive-drab green or brown to copper or bronze and more recently, darker, subdued orange shades. Famous for its docile, friendly personality and large size, it is considered a sign of good luck among koi keepers.
* {{Nihongo|''Asagi''|浅黄}} koi is light blue above and usually red below, but also occasionally pale yellow or cream, generally below the lateral line and on the cheeks. The Japanese name means pale greenish-blue, [[spring onion]] color, or [[indigo]].
* {{Nihongo|''Utsurimono''|写り物}} is a black koi with white, red, or yellow markings, in a [[zebra]] color pattern. The oldest attested form is the yellow form, called {{Nihongo|"black and yellow markings"|黒黄斑|''Kuro ki madara''}} in the 19th century, but renamed {{Nihongo|''Ki Utsuri''|黄写り}} by [[Elizaburo Hoshino]], an early 20th-century koi breeder. The red and white versions are called {{Nihongo|''Hi Utsuri''|緋写り}} and {{Nihongo|''Shiro Utsuri''|白写り}} (piebald color morph), respectively. The word ''utsuri'' means to print (the black markings are reminiscent of ink stains). Genetically, it is the same as ''Showa'', but lacking either red pigment (''Shiro Utsuri'') or white pigment (''Hi Utsuri''/''Ki Utsuri'').
* {{Nihongo|''Bekko''|鼈甲、べっ甲}} is a white-, red-, or yellow-skinned koi with black markings {{Nihongo|''sumi''|墨}}. The Japanese name means "tortoise shell", and is commonly written as 鼈甲. The white, red, and yellow varieties are called {{Nihongo|''Shiro Bekko''|白}}, {{Nihongo|''Aka Bekko''|赤}} and {{Nihongo|''Ki Bekko''|黄}}, respectively. It may be confused with the ''Utsuri''.
* {{Nihongo|''Goshiki''|五色}} is a dark koi with red (''Kōhaku'' style) ''hi'' pattern. The Japanese name means "five colors". It appears similar to an ''Asagi'', with little or no ''hi'' below the lateral line and a ''Kōhaku Hi'' pattern over reticulated (fishnet pattern) scales. The base color can range from nearly black to very pale, sky blue.
* '{{Nihongo|''Shūsui''|秋翠}} means "autumn green"; the ''Shūsui'' was created in 1910 by Yoshigoro Akiyama（[[:ja:秋山　吉五郎|秋山　吉五郎]], by crossing Japanese ''Asagi'' with German [[mirror carp]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The fish has no scales, except for a single line of large mirror scales dorsally, extending from head to tail. The most common type of ''Shūsui'' has a pale, [[sky-blue]]/gray color above the lateral line and red or orange (and very, very rarely bright yellow) below the lateral line and on the cheeks.
* {{Nihongo|''Kinginrin''|金銀鱗}} is a koi with metallic (glittering, metal-flake-appearing) scales. The name translates into English as "gold and silver scales"; it is often abbreviated to ''Ginrin''. ''Ginrin'' versions of almost all other varieties of koi occur, and they are fashionable. Their sparkling, glittering scales contrast to the smooth, even, metallic skin and scales seen in the ''Ogon'' varieties. Recently, these characteristics have been combined to create the new ''ginrin Ogon'' varieties.
* {{Nihongo|''Kawarimono''|変わり物}} is a "catch-all" term for koi that cannot be put into one of the other categories. This is a competition category, and many new varieties of koi compete in this one category. It is also known as {{Nihongo|''kawarigoi''|変わり鯉}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
* {{Nihongo|''Ōgon''|黄金}} is a metallic koi of one color only (''hikarimono'' 光者). The most commonly encountered colors are gold, platinum, and orange. Cream specimens are very rare.  ''Ogon'' compete in the ''Kawarimono'' category and the Japanese name means "gold".  The variety was created by Sawata Aoki in 1946 from wild carp he caught in 1921. &lt;!-- Recently, the metallic-skinned ''Ogon'' is being crossed with ''ginrin''-scaled fish to create the'' ginrin Ogon'' with metallic skin and sparkling (metal flake) scales.--&gt;
* {{Nihongo|''Kumonryū''|九紋竜}}' （literally "nine tattooed dragons" is a black ''doitsu''-scaled fish with curling white markings. The patterns are thought to be reminiscent of Japanese ink paintings of dragons. They famously change color with the seasons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} ''Kumonryu ''compete in the ''Kawarimono'' category.
* {{Nihongo|''Ochiba''|落葉}} is a light blue/gray koi with copper, bronze, or yellow (''Kohaku''-style) pattern, reminiscent of autumn leaves on water. The Japanese name means "fallen leaves".
* {{Nihongo|''Koromo''|衣}} is a white fish with a ''Kohaku''-style pattern with blue or black-edged scales only over the ''hi'' pattern. This variety first arose in the 1950s as a cross between a ''Kohaku'' and an ''Asagi''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The most commonly encountered ''Koromo'' is an ''Ai Goromo'', which is colored like a ''Kohaku'', except each of the scales within the red patches has a blue or black edge to it. Less common is the ''Budo-Goromo'', which has a darker (burgundy) ''hi'' overlay that gives it the appearance of bunches of grapes. Very rarely seen is the ''Tsumi-Goromo'', which is similar to ''Budo-Goromo'', but the ''hi'' pattern is such a dark burgundy that it appears nearly black.
* {{Nihongo|''Hikari-moyomono''|光模樣者}} is a koi with colored markings over a metallic base or in two metallic colors.
* ''Kikokuryū'' (輝黒竜, literally "sparkle" or "glitter black dragon") is a metallic-skinned version of the ''Kumonryu''.
* ''Kin-Kikokuryū'' (金輝黒竜, literally "gold sparkle black dragon" or "gold glitter black dragon") is a metallic-skinned version of the ''Kumonryu'' with a ''Kohaku''-style ''hi'' pattern developed by Mr. Seiki Igarashi of Ojiya City. At least six different genetic subvarieties of this general variety are seen.
* Ghost koi ([[:ja:人面魚|人面魚]]、[[:ja:じんめんぎょ|じんめんぎょ]]), a hybrid of ''Ogon'' and wild carp with metallic scales, is considered by some to be not ''nishikigoi''.
* [[Butterfly koi]] ([[:ja:鰭長錦鯉|鰭長錦鯉]]、[[:ja:ひれながにしきごい|ひれながにしきごい]]) is a hybrid of koi and Asian carp with long flowing fins. Various colorations depend on the koi stock used to cross. It also is considered by some to not be ''nishikigoi''.
* {{Nihongo|''[[Doitsu-goi]]''|ドイツ鯉}} originated by crossbreeding numerous different established varieties with "scaleless" [[German carp]] (generally, fish with only a single line of scales along each side of the dorsal fin). Also written as 独逸鯉, four main types of ''Doitsu'' scale patterns exist. The most common type (referred to above) has a row of scales beginning at the front of the dorsal fin and ending at the end of the dorsal fin (along both sides of the fin). The second type has a row of scales beginning where the head meets the shoulder and running the entire length of the fish (along both sides). The third type is the same as the second, with the addition of a line of (often quite large) scales running along the lateral line (along the side) of the fish, also referred to as "mirror koi". The fourth (and rarest) type is referred to as "armor koi" and is completely (or nearly) covered with very large scales that resemble plates of armor. It also is called ''Kagami-goi'' (鏡鯉、カガミゴイ), or mirror carp (ミラーカープ).

== Differences from goldfish ==
[[File:Koi head closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Koi have prominent [[barbels]] on the lip that are not visible in goldfish.]]

[[Goldfish]] were developed in [[China]] more than a thousand years ago by [[selectively breeding]] Prussian carp for color [[mutation]]s. By the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), yellow, orange, white, and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish (''Carassius auratus'') and [[Prussian carp]] (''Carassius gibelio'') are now considered different species. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century and to Europe in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="bristol" /&gt; Koi, though, were developed from common carp in Japan in the 1820s. Koi are domesticated common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'') that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species, but a subspecies, and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely.

The length of a koi can average up to about 3.28 feet. On average they also grow about 2 centimeters per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Essential Guide for Koi Fish Owner: How to Build and Maintain a Beautiful Koi Pond |last=Lee |first=Richard |date=2013-08-03 |publisher=Lulu Press, Inc |year= |isbn=978-1-304-28627-7 |location= |pages= |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, goldfish may only grow to be around a foot.  In general, goldfish tend to be smaller than koi, and have a greater variety of body shapes and fin and tail configurations. Koi varieties tend to have a common body shape, but have a greater variety of coloration and color patterns. They also have prominent [[barbels]] on the lip. Some goldfish varieties, such as the [[common goldfish]], [[comet goldfish]], and [[shubunkin]], have body shapes and coloration that are similar to koi, and can be difficult to tell apart from koi when immature. Goldfish and koi can interbreed; however, as they were developed from different species of carp, their offspring are sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The difference between koi and goldfish |url=http://www.livingthecountrylife.com/animals/difference-between-koi-and-goldfish/page/0/1 |website=Living the Country Life |accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aquatic-oasis"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aquatic-oasis.com/articles.htm |title=Aquatic-oasis articles |publisher=Aquatic-oasis |accessdate=2 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622235948/http://www.aquatic-oasis.com/articles.htm |archivedate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health, maintenance, and longevity ==
[[File:Hanako.jpg|thumb|[[Hanako (fish)|Hanako]], a Japanese Koi that lived for 226 years (1751–1977).]]
[[File:Yuyuan Garden.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Koi in [[Yu Garden]], [[Shanghai]]]]
The common carp is a hardy fish, and koi retain that durability. Koi are cold-water fish, but benefit from being kept in the {{convert|15|–|25|C|F}} range, and do not react well to long, cold, winter temperatures; their immune systems are very weak below 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Koi ponds usually have a metre or more of depth in areas of the world that become warm during the summer, whereas in areas that have harsher winters, ponds generally have a minimum of {{convert|1.5|m|ft|frac=2|abbr=on}}. Specific pond construction has been evolved by koi keepers intent on raising show-quality koi.

The bright colors of koi put them at a severe disadvantage against predators; a white-skinned ''Kohaku'' is a visual dinner bell against the dark green of a pond. [[Heron]]s, [[kingfisher]]s, [[otter]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[cat]]s, [[fox]]es, [[Badger (animal)|badgers]], and [[Hedgehog|hedgehogs]] are all capable of emptying a pond of its fish. A well-designed outdoor pond has areas too deep for herons to stand, overhangs high enough above the water that mammals cannot reach in, and shade trees overhead to block the view of aerial passers-by. It may prove necessary to string nets or wires above the surface. A pond usually includes a [[pump]] and [[Koi pond|filtration]] system to keep the water clear.

Koi are an omnivorous fish. They eat a wide variety of foods, including peas, lettuce, and watermelon. Koi food is designed not only to be nutritionally balanced, but also to float so as to encourage them to come to the surface. When they are eating,  koi can be checked for parasites and ulcers. Naturally, koi are bottom feeders with a mouth configuration adapted for that. Some koi have a tendency to eat mostly from the bottom, so food producers create a mixed sinking and floating combination food. Koi recognize the persons feeding them and gather around them at feeding times. They can be trained to take food from one's hand. In the winter, their digestive systems slow nearly to a halt, and they eat very little, perhaps no more than nibbles of algae from the bottom. Feeding is not recommended when the water temperature drops below {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lagunakoi.com/Koi-Feeding-Guide-Library-sc-334.html |title=Koi Feeding Guide |work=lagunakoi.com |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mitchkoi.co.uk/koikeepingtips/best-temperature-feed-koi-fish/ |title=Temperatures to feed koi fish |work=mitchkoi.co.uk |accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Care should be taken by hobbyists that proper oxygenation, pH stabilization, and off-gassing occur over the winter in small ponds, so they do not perish. Their appetites do not come back until the water becomes warm in the spring.

Koi have been reported to achieve ages of 100–200 years.&lt;ref name="HuntingfordJobling2012"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Felicity Huntingford |author2=Malcolm Jobling |author3=Sunil Kadri |title=Aquaculture and Behavior |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9pnZqx7788C&amp;pg=PA12 |date=2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-3089-9 |pages=12– |quote=... and there are reports of fish that have achieved ages of 100–200 years (Purdom 1993; Billard 1999).}}&lt;/ref&gt; One famous scarlet koi named "[[Hanako (fish)|Hanako]]" was owned by several individuals, the last of whom was Komei Koshihara.

=== Disease ===
Koi are very hardy. With proper care, they resist many of the parasites that affect more sensitive tropical fish species, such as ''[[Trichodina]], [[Epistylis]]'', and ''[[Ichthyophthirius multifiliis]]'' infections. Water pH is important for maintaining koi's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_q9TCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=koi+fish+information&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZw_vH6LDTAhWkjlQKHbsEAQIQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Essential Guide for Koi Fish Owner: How to Build and Maintain a Beautiful Koi Pond |last=Lee |first=Richard |date=2013-08-03 |publisher=Lulu Press, Inc |isbn=978-1-304-28627-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water changes help reduce the risk of diseases and keep koi not stressed. Two of the biggest health concerns among koi breeders are the [[koi herpes virus]] (KHV) and [[rhabdovirus]] carpio, which causes [[spring viraemia of carp]] (SVC). No treatment is known for either disease. Some koi farms in Israel use the KV3 vaccine, developed by Prof. M. Kotler from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and produced by Kovax, to immunise fish against KHV. Israel is currently the only country in the world to vaccinate koi against the KHV. The vaccine is injected into the fish when they are under one year old, and is accentuated by using an [[ultraviolet]] light. The vaccine has a 90% success rate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kovax.co.il/products/kv3-vaccine-against-khv/ "KV3 Vaccine against KHV"]. KoVax Ltd. – Specializes in Aqua culture vaccines development and Manufacturing.&lt;/ref&gt; and when immunized, the fish cannot succumb to a KHV outbreak and neither can the immunised koi pass KHV onto other fish in a pond.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Paula (October 2011) [http://www.mitchkoi.co.uk/media/In-Focus-KHV.pdf ISRAELI KOI ...and the battle against KHV]. mitchkoi.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[biosecurity]] measures such as prompt detection, [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]], and [[disinfection]] of tanks and equipment can prevent the spread of the disease and limit the loss of fish stock. In 2002, spring viraemia struck an ornamental koi farm in [[Kernersville, North Carolina]], and required complete depopulation of the ponds and a lengthy quarantine period. For a while after this, some koi farmers in neighboring states stopped importing fish for fear of infecting their own stocks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225841/http://www.sfbakc.org/Articles/SVC_Impact.htm Spring Viremia of Carp].

== Breeding ==
When koi naturally breed on their own they tend to spawn in the spring and summer seasons. The male will start following the female, swimming right behind her and nudging her. After the female koi releases her eggs they sink to the bottom of the pond and stay there. A sticky outer shell around the egg helps keep it in place so it does not float around. Although the female can produce many spawns, many of the fry do not survive due to being eaten by others. On average if the egg survives around 4–7 days the fry will be hatched from the egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_q9TCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=koi+fish+information&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZw_vH6LDTAhWkjlQKHbsEAQIQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Essential Guide for Koi Fish Owner: How to Build and Maintain a Beautiful Koi Pond |last=Lee |first=Richard |date=2013-08-03 |publisher=Lulu Press, Inc |isbn=978-1-304-28627-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Koi4.jpg|thumb|right|Koi in an outdoor [[koi pond]]]]

Like most fish, koi reproduce through spawning in which a female lays a vast number of eggs and one or more males fertilize them. Nurturing the resulting offspring (referred to as "fry") is a tricky and tedious job, usually done only by professionals. Although a koi breeder may carefully select the parents they wish based on their desired characteristics, the resulting fry nonetheless exhibit a wide range of color and quality.

Koi produce thousands of offspring from a single spawning. However, unlike cattle, purebred dogs, or more relevantly, goldfish, the large majority of these offspring, even from the best champion-grade koi, are not acceptable as ''nishikigoi'' (they have no interesting colors) or may even be genetically defective. These unacceptable offspring are culled at various stages of development based on the breeder's expert eye and closely guarded trade techniques. Culled fry are usually destroyed or used as feeder fish (mostly used for feeding [[Asian arowana|arowana]] due to the belief it will enhance its color), while older culls, within their first year between 3 and 6 inches long (also called ''tosai''), are often sold as lower-grade, pond-quality koi.

The semirandomized result of the koi's reproductive process has both advantages and disadvantages for the breeder. While it requires diligent oversight to narrow down the favorable result the breeder wants, it also makes possible the development of new varieties of koi within relatively few generations.

== In the wild ==
[[File:Koi Feeding in Mt Qingxiu Nanning Close.JPG|right|thumb|Various colors of koi feeding in a pond in Qingxiu Mountain, [[Nanning, China]]]]
{{See also|Common carp}}

Koi have been accidentally or deliberately released into the wild in every continent except [[Antarctica]]. They quickly revert to the natural coloration of common carp within a few generations. In many areas, they are considered an [[invasive species]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. In the state of Queensland in Australia, they are considered noxious fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/fisheries/pest-fish/noxious-fish/carp "Carp"]. ''daff.qld.gov.au''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koi greatly increase the [[turbidity]] of the water because they are constantly stirring up the substrate. This makes waterways unattractive, reduces the abundance of aquatic plants, and can render the water unsuitable for swimming or drinking, even by livestock. In some countries, koi have caused so much damage to waterways that vast amounts of money and effort have been spent trying to eradicate them, largely unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.asp?speciesID=4 "Common Carp (''Cyprinus carpio'') – FactSheet"]. ''usgs.gov''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many areas of North America, koi are introduced into the artificial "water hazards" and ponds on golf courses to keep water-borne insect larvae under control through predation.

== Koi in culture == 
The koi fish is symbolic in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] and is closely associated with the country's national identity. The koi fish is a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good fortune in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://yourkoipond.com/koi-carp-japanese-culture/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sri Lanka]], interior courtyards most often have one or several fish ponds dedicated to koi fish.&lt;ref&gt;http://thevoyageur.net/2014/12/05/the-detail-koi-fish-pond-sri-lanka/&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka is the sixth largest cultivator of ornamental fish in the world after Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Are-you-interested-in-ornamental-fish-culture-_69942&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''domestic canary''', often simply known as the '''canary''' (''Serinus canaria'' forma ''domestica''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21711192 | doi=10.1080/03079457.2011.571660 | volume=40 | title=Experimental infection of domestic canaries (Serinus canaria domestica) with Mycoplasma gallisepticum: a new model system for a wildlife disease | journal=Avian Pathol | pages=321–7 | last1 = Hawley | first1 = DM | last2 = Grodio | first2 = J | last3 = Frasca | first3 = S | last4 = Kirkpatrick | first4 = L | last5 = Ley | first5 = DH}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] form of the wild [[Atlantic canary|canary]], a small [[songbird]] in the [[finch]] [[Family (biology)|family]] originating from the [[Macaronesia|Macaronesian Islands]] (The [[Azores]], [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]]).

Canaries were first bred in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] in the 17th century. They were brought over by Spanish [[sailor]]s to Europe. This bird became expensive and fashionable to breed in courts of Spanish and English kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Arnaiz-Villena|first = A. |author2=Ruiz-del-Valle V. |author3=Areces C.|title = El Origen de los Canarios|journal = Ornitología Práctica|volume=53|pages=3–11|date=May 2012|url = http://chopo.pntic.mec.es/biolmol/publicaciones/origencanarios.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnaiz-Villena|first=A|author2=Gómez-Prieto P |author3=Ruiz-de-Valle V |title= Phylogeography of finches and sparrows|journal=Nova Science Publishers|year=2009|ISBN=978-1-60741-844--3|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/downloadOA.php?order=1&amp;access=true&amp;osCsid=578391717583ba2180ffa42bf304e1f6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks started breeding them and only sold the males (which sing).  This kept the birds in short supply and drove the price up.  Eventually, Italians obtained hens and were able to breed the birds.  This made them very popular, resulted in many breeds arising, and the birds being bred all over Europe.

The same occurred in England.  First the birds were only owned by the rich, but eventually the local citizens started to breed them and, again, they became very popular.  Many breeds arose through selective breeding, and they are still very popular today for their voices.

From the eighteenth up to twentieth centuries, canaries and [[finches]] were used in the UK, Canada and USA in the [[coal mining]] industry, to detect [[carbon monoxide]]. In the UK, this practice ceased in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eschener |first1=Kat |title=The Story of the Real Canary in the Coal Mine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/story-real-canary-coal-mine-180961570/ |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=Smithsonian |date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the domestic canary is kept as a popular [[birdcage|cage]] and [[aviary]] bird. Given proper housing and care, a canary's lifespan ranges from 10 to 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The birds are named after [[Spain]]'s [[Canary Islands]], which derive their name from the Latin ''Insula Canaria'' (after one of the larger islands, [[Gran Canaria]]), meaning "island of dogs", due to its "vast multitudes of dogs of very large size".&lt;ref name="Tiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hudson Tiner|title=Exploring the World of Biology: From Mushrooms to Complex Life Forms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiA1dInKyAMC&amp;pg=PT27|access-date=25 July 2012|date=12 January 2009|publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89051-552-5|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pliny the Elder"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Plin.%20Nat.%206.37 | title=Natural History | access-date=July 25, 2012 | author=[[Pliny the Elder]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canary nesting.jpg|thumb|left|A white canary nesting]]
[[File:YellowCanary.jpg|thumb|right|A yellow canary perched in a tree]]

==Varieties==
Canaries are generally divided into three main groups:
*Colour-bred canaries (bred for their many colour [[mutation]]s&amp;nbsp;– ino, eumo, satinette, bronze, ivory, onyx, mosaic, brown and [[red factor canary|red factor]] etc.)
*Type canaries (bred for their shape and conformation&amp;nbsp;– [[Australian plainhead]], Berner, Border, Fife, Gibber Italicus, Gloster, Lancashire, Raza Española, Yorkshire, etc.)
*Song canaries (bred for their unique and specific song patterns&amp;nbsp;– Spanish Timbrado, German Roller (also known as [[Harz Roller]]), Waterslager (also known as "Malinois"), American Singer, Russian Singer, Persian Singer).

While wild canaries are a yellowish-green colour, domestic canaries have been selectively bred for a wide variety of colours, such as yellow, orange, brown, black, white, and red. (The colour red was introduced to the domesticated canary through [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] with the [[red siskin]], a type of South American finch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birkhead|first=Tim|title=A Brand-New Bird: How Two Amateur Geneticists Create the First Genetically Engineered Animal|year=2003|publisher=Basic Books|location=NY, NY|isbn=978-0-465-00665-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Competitions==
Canaries are judged in competitions following the annual [[Moulting#In birds|molt]] in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=Linda S.|title=The Complete Canary Handbook: A Collection of Canary Tales|year=1999|publisher=self-published|asin=B0006RK73W|url=http://canarytales.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that in the Northern Hemisphere the show season generally begins in October or November and runs through December or January. Birds can only be shown by the persons who raised them. A show bird must have a unique band on its leg indicating the year of birth, the band number, and the club to which the breeder belongs.

There are many canary shows all over the world. The world show (C.O.M. - Confederation Ornithologique Mondiale) is held in Europe each year and attracts thousands of breeders.  As many as 20,000 birds are brought together for this competition.

==Miner's canary==&lt;!--Linked from 'Biosensor'--&gt;
Canaries were once regularly used in [[coal mining]] as an early warning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Page, Walter Hines |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 1914 |author2= Page, Arthur Wilson   |title=Man And His Machines: Resuscitation Cage For Mine Canaries |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XXVIII (May to October 1914) |pages=474 |id= |url=https://archive.org/details/worldswork28gard |access-date=2016-09-19 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toxic]] [[gas]]es such as [[carbon monoxide]] or [[methane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Biggins |first1=Peter |last2=Kusterbeck |first2=Anne | last3=Hilt |first3=John | date=2001 |title=Bio-inspired Materials and Sensing Systems |page=6 |ISBN=1849731217 |URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHG6-t8gWVQC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6 | access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mine would kill the bird before affecting the miners. Signs of distress from the bird indicated to the miners that conditions were unsafe. The use of miners' canaries in [[Great Britain|British]] mines was phased out in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/30/newsid_2547000/2547587.stm | work=BBC News | title=1986: Coal mine canaries made redundant | date=1986-12-30 | access-date=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "[[wikt:canary in a coal mine|canary in a coal mine]]" is frequently used to refer to a person or thing which serves as an early warning of a coming crisis. By analogy, the term "climate canary" is used to refer to a species that is affected by an environmental danger prior to other species, thus serving as an early warning system for the other species with regard to the danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6240055.stm | work=BBC News | title='Plutoed' voted US word of year | date=2007-01-08 | access-date=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[indicator species]].)

==Use in research==
Canaries have been extensively used in research to study [[neurogenesis]], or the birth of new neurons in the adult brain, and also for basic research in order to understand how songbirds encode and produce song. Thus, canaries have served as model species for discovering how the vertebrate brain learns, consolidates memories, and recalls coordinated motor movements.

[[Fernando Nottebohm]], a professor at the [[Rockefeller University]] in [[New York City]], detailed the brain structures and pathways that are involved in the production of bird song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/FernandoNottebohm/|title= Fernando Nottebohm, Ph.D.|publisher= The Rockefeller University |access-date=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://sites.lafayette.edu/neur401-sp10/what-is-neurogenesis/neurogenesis-in-birds/|title= Neurogenesis in Birds|publisher= Neurogenesis |access-date=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
In organized crime, the canary symbolizes an informant who "sings to the police."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Fitzgerald | first1=Dennis | year=2014 | title=Informants, Cooperating Witnesses, and Undercover Investigations: A Practical Guide to Law, Policy, and Procedure, Second Edition | url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=xo3aBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canaries have been depicted in [[cartoon]]s from the mid-20th century as being harassed by domestic [[cat]]s; the most famous cartoon canary is [[Warner Bros.]]' "[[Tweety]]".

[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] team, is nicknamed "The Canaries" due to the city once being a famous centre for breeding and export of the birds. The club adopted the colours of yellow and green in homage. Jacob Mackley, of Norwich, won many prizes with birds of the local variety and shipped about 10,000 from Norwich to New York every year. In the early 1900s, he opened his aviaries to the public for three days and 10,000 people turned up.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} A number of other sports teams worldwide use variations of the name "Canaries", such as [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]] (Italy), [[FC Koper|Koper]] (Slovenia), [[FK Novi Sad|FC Novi Sad]] (Serbia), [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]] (Turkey), [[Kedah FA]] (Malaysia), the [[Brazil national football team]] and the [[Brazil women's national football team]].

'''Breed clubs''' are [[Voluntary association|associations]] or [[Club (organization)|club]]s with activities centered on a single, specific [[breed]] of a particular [[species]] of [[domesticated animal]]. The purpose of the association will vary with the species of animal and the goals and needs of the members of the association. Breed associations or clubs may vary in their goals, activities and nomenclature from country to country, even for the same breed. Most domesticated animals, whether they are agricultural animals such as cattle, llamas, poultry, sheep and pigs, or companion animals such as pigeons, horses, cats and dogs, have breed clubs associated with the breed.

== Purpose ==
In general, breed clubs and associations create a written definition of the breed (called a breed standard) for the breed with which the organization is associated. Breed clubs also maintain important records, and provide members with information. Many breed associations also have a social component, organising various activities such as shows. In addition, they may regulate breeding or raise funds for research related to the breed.

=== Examples ===
*In [[horse]]s, the Appaloosa Horse Club, established in 1938, maintains a registry for Appaloosa horses, and has the goal of "preserving the horses’ heritage and history" and defining the [[horse]] breed through bloodline requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appaloosa.com/pdfs/rulebook09.pdf The Appaloosa Horse Club, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Canadian Lowline Cattle Association defines its objectives as including "maintain the purity and improve the breed" of [[cattle]] as well as collecting maintaining breed information and publishing a Herd Book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clrc.ca/11by-laws.pdf Canadian Lowline Cattle Association by-laws]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Essex Pig Society is building up the numbers of the [[Essex Pig]], formerly thought to be an extinct breed of the [[domestic pig]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colchester-zoo.co.uk/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&amp;Press_Release_ID=36  “Jimmy’s Farm”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012094649/http://www.colchester-zoo.co.uk/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&amp;Press_Release_ID=36 |date=October 12, 2008 }} 22-Apr-05&lt;/ref&gt;
*The American Buttercup Club defines its goal as connecting fanciers of the [[chicken]] breed so that they are "able to share stock and valuable information about the breed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026213354/http://geocities.com/americanbuttercupclub/ American Buttercup Club, The Crown of the Fancy]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Fantail Club UK, established in 1889, promotes the knowledge and enjoyment of the exhibition Fantail [[Pigeon]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/dc/fantail/home.html The Fantail Club] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227051932/http://www.angelfire.com/dc/fantail/home.html |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[domestic cat|cats]], the Selkirk Rex Breed Club maintains a history of the breed and provides care and grooming tips to owners of the breed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selkirkrexcats.org/ Selkirk Rex Breed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302005809/http://www.selkirkrexcats.org/ |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Members of the [[dog]] breed club for the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) are expected to "conduct themselves in a responsible and sportsman-like manner at all times."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-toy-terrier.co.uk/ethics.htm English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) Club] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002072224/http://www.english-toy-terrier.co.uk/ethics.htm |date=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The OEGB Int'l Society proudly connects hobbyists of Old English Game Bantams from all around the world to discuss poultry related topics.  In addition, it hosts the only US based OEGB futurity as an annual event called the MegaSpur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldenglishgamebantams.com OEGB Int'l Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forming a breed club ==
With the advent of the internet, anyone can create a "breed club" by putting up a web page to advertise their animals. Buyers must research any claims of unaffiliated breed clubs.

== Organizations covering groups of breeds ==
Breeds of animals of a particular species may have an organization that covers a large number of breeds of the species, even though each individual breed may have its own breed club. Often the multiple-breed over-association will maintain the breed records in a central location. An example of this would be the Canadian Sheep Breeder's Association, incorporated under the Canadian Livestock Pedigree Act in 1915, which includes fifty different breeds of [[sheep]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clrc.ca/sheep.shtml Canadian Sheep Breeder's Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other types of animal associations ==
Associations that include all breeds (as well as crossbred and mixed breed animals) of a particular species also exist. Usually such associations are organized for particular sports, such as hunting with [[Bird of prey|raptors]].

The '''fancy rat''' (''Rattus norvegicus domestica'') is the [[domestication|domesticated]] form of ''Rattus norvegicus''; it is a subspecies of the [[brown rat]].&lt;ref name="langton-history"&gt;{{cite book | title = Rat: How the World's Most Notorious Rodent Clawed Its Way to the Top | first = Jerry | last = Langton | chapter = Entertainer, Test Subject, and Family Friend | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=n488n52-wYUC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0 | publisher = Macmillan | accessdate=8 January 2009 | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-312-36384-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''fancy rat'' derives from the idea of [[animal fancy|animal ''fancy'']] (the promotion of domesticated animals) or the phrase "to fancy" (meaning to like or appreciate).&lt;ref name="MMratdoc" /&gt;  Wild-caught specimens that become docile and are bred for many generations still fall under the ''fancy'' type.

Fancy rats were originally targets for [[blood sport]] in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Later bred as pets, they now come in a wide variety of coat colors and patterns, and are bred and raised by several rat enthusiast groups around the world. They are sold in [[pet store]]s and by breeders.

Fancy rats care for themselves and are affordable, even compared to other small pets. This is one of their biggest draws. Additionally, they are quite independent, loyal and easily trained. They are considered more intelligent than other domesticated rodents. Healthy fancy rats typically live 2 to 3 years.

Fancy rats are used widely in medical research, as their physiology is very similar to that of humans. When used in this field, they are referred to as [[laboratory rat]]s.

Domesticated rats are physiologically and psychologically different from their wild relatives, and typically pose no more of a [[Zoonosis|health risk]] than other common pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Zoonoses:Introduction |url= http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/220100.htm |chapter=Table on Global Zoonoses|year=2008|publisher=Merck and Co., Inc|accessdate=11 January 2009|chapter-url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/htm/bc/tzns01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat,&lt;ref name="JAVMA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orloski|first=Kathleen A.|author2=Sarah L.

== History ==
[[File:Rat-baiting6.jpg|thumb|left|It may seem surprising that the blood sport of rat-baiting was an antecedent for the practice of keeping rats as pets.]]
[[File:Das festliche Jahr img364 Her Majestys Rat-catcher.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jack Black (rat catcher)|Jack Black]] made his living not only from catching rats, but also from selling them for use in baiting.]]
The origin of the modern fancy rat begins with the [[rat-catcher]]s of the 18th and 19th centuries who trapped rats throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="langton-history" /&gt; These rat-catchers would then either kill the rats, or, more likely, sell the rats to be used in blood sport.&lt;ref name="krinke"&gt;{{cite book | last = Krinke | first = George J. | others = Gillian R. Bullock (series ed.), Tracie Bunton (series ed.) | title = The Laboratory Rat (Handbook of Experimental Animals) | publisher = Academic Press | date = 15 June 2000 | pages = 3–16 | chapter = History, Strains and Models | isbn = 0-12-426400-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rat-baiting]] was a popular sport until the beginning of the 20th century. It involved filling a pit with several rats and then placing bets on how long it would take a [[terrier]] to kill them all. It is believed that both rat-catchers and sportsmen began to keep certain, odd-colored rats during the height of the sport, eventually breeding them and then selling them as pets.&lt;ref name="langton-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rmca-history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rmca.org/Articles/domestication.htm | title = The Domestication of the Rat | last = Hilscher-Conklin | first = Caryl | publisher=Rat &amp; Mouse Club of America | accessdate = 10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men thought to have formed the basis of rat fancy are [[Jack Black (rat catcher)|Jack Black]], self-proclaimed rat-catcher to [[Queen Victoria]], and [[Jemmy Shaw|Jimmy Shaw]], manager of one of the largest sporting public houses in London. These two men are responsible for beginning many of the color varieties present today.&lt;ref name="langton-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afrma-history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://afrma.org/rminfo4a.htm | title = The History of Fancy Rats | publisher = American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association | accessdate = 10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black, specifically, was known for taming the "prettier" rats of unusual color, decorating them with ribbons, and selling them as pets.

Rat fancy as a formal, organized hobby began when a woman named Mary Douglas asked for permission to bring her pet rats to an exhibition of the National Mouse Club at the [[Aylesbury]] Town Show in England on October 24, 1901. Her black-and-white hooded rat won "Best in Show" and ignited interest in the area. After Douglas' death in 1921, rat fancy soon began to fall back out of fashion. The original hobby formally lasted from 1912 to 1929 or 1931, as part of the National Mouse and Rat Club, at which point ''Rat'' was dropped from the name, returning it to the original National Mouse Club. The hobby was revived in 1976 with the formation of the English [[National Fancy Rat Society]] (NFRS).&lt;ref name="langton-history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afrma-history" /&gt; Pet rats are now commonly available in stores and from breeders, and there exist several rat fancier groups worldwide.

== Differences from wild rats ==
{{See also|Brown rat#Biology and behavior|l1=Brown rat|Laboratory rat}}

While domesticated rats are not removed enough from their wild counterparts to justify a distinct subspecies (compare ''[[Canis lupus familiaris]]''), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent is coloring. Random color [[mutation]]s may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild ''R. norvegicus'' are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from [[#Varieties|white to cinnamon to blue]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to specific information in the [[#Varieties|Varieties]] section&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are [[Taming|tamer]] than those in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=John|title=Animals in Person: Cultural Perspectives on Human-animal Intimacy|publisher=Berg Publishers|year=2005|pages=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTycF9esNdIC&amp;pg=PA131|isbn=1-85973-733-1|accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are more comfortable around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and for a longer period of time over their lifespan.&lt;ref name="barnett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=S. Anthony|title=The Story of Rats: Their Impact on Us, and Our Impact on Them|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Australia|date=April 1, 2002|pages=21–23|chapter=Naming and Taming|isbn=978-1-86508-519-7|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSHVlTr-PpsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA21,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position.&lt;ref name="fighting"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aggressive behavior in the rat|doi=10.1016/S0091-6773(77)90308-X|year=1977|author=Blanchard, R|journal=Behavioral Biology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=197–224|pmid=562152|last2=Carolineblanchard|first2=D}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behavioral traits are thought to be [[Nature versus nurture|products of environment as opposed to genetics]]. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare [[Domesticated silver fox]]).&lt;ref name="barnett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="price"&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Edward O.|title=Animal Domestication and Behavior|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2003|isbn=0-85199-597-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body structure of domesticated rats differs from that of a wild rat as well. The body of a fancy rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail than that of its undomesticated counterpart. They are generally smaller with sharper facial features as well.

Domesticated rats have a longer lifespan than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild ''R. norvegicus'' which average a lifespan of less than one year.&lt;ref name="langton-lifespan"&gt;{{cite book|page=168|chapter=Second Only to Us|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312363842|title=Rat: How the World's Most Notorious Rodent Clawed Its Way to the Top |date=26 June 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-36384-2|accessdate=13 November 2008|first=Jerry|last=Langton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats.&lt;ref name="barnett" /&gt; The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing [[#Health|health concerns]]; the former is at risk of developing a [[pneumococcal infection]] from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with [[Vector (epidemiology)|carriers]] like cockroaches and fleas.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to specific information in the [[#Health|Health]] section.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social behavior ==
{{See also|Brown rat#Social behavior|label 1=Social behavior in the brown rat}}Generally speaking, rats are quite sociable and function best with at least one cage mate. It is generally ill-advised to keep a single rat unless there are severe behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier rats are introduced to one another, the better and oftentimes, rat breeders will encourage new owners to take two or more rats of the same gender from the same litter for starters.[[File:Rats young.jpg|thumb|Young rats (Approximately 3 weeks old)]]   Particularly with males, there can be some fighting in the beginning, but once an alpha rat has been determined, the rats should get along well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Domestic Fancy Rats|url=http://www.altpet.net/rodents/rats/rf13.html|work=Can 2 male rats co-exist in one cage?|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks to a month, the rats will most likely have adjusted and become friendlier with each other. Rats are generally very friendly to other cage mates. They will even sometimes help or take care of other sick rats.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement claims the existence of a specific behavior in rats that is unsubstantiated by the author.|date=April 2017}}
Generally when two or more rats from the same litter are of the same sex they live together with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have to be taken to provide security for both rats.
Techniques for integration include bringing them to neutral ground so they do not become territorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ducommun|first1=Debbie|title=Introducing new Rats|url=http://www.ratfanclub.org/newrat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of integrating is easiest with two rats of young age, generally less than six months old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Varieties ==
{{for|varieties bred as lab animals|Laboratory rat#Stocks and strains}}{{For|other rat varieties|List of rat varieties (disambiguation){{!}}List of rat varieties}}&lt;!--

Before changing COLOUR to COLOR please refer to WP:ENGVAR. The fancy rat originated in England, so it is fitting to keep British spellings in this article.

--&gt;
[[File:Americanblue.jpg|thumb|left|The American Blue is one of several standardized coat colors.]]
As in other pet species, a variety of colors, [[coat (animal)|coat]] types, and other features that do not appear in the wild have either been [[selective breeding|developed]], or have appeared spontaneously. Fancy Rats in themselves are a subspecies and as such do not have distinctive breeds. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.&lt;ref name="MMratdoc"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rats|url=http://www.tv.com/modern-marvels/rats/episode/1195778/summary.html?tag=episode_tabs;overview|series=[[Modern Marvels]]|credits=Writer: Kaylan Eggert Narrator: Max Raphael|network=History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coloring ===
While some pet rats retain the [[Agouti gene|agouti]] coloring of the wild brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include '''agouti''', '''cinnamon''', and '''fawn'''. Black-based colors include '''black''', '''beige''', and '''chocolate'''.&lt;ref name="ratgen" /&gt;

Eye color is considered a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or ''vice versa''. The [[American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association]] (AFRMA) lists '''black''', '''pink''', '''ruby''', and [[Heterochromia iridum|'''odd-eyed''']] (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown.&lt;ref name=afrma-std /&gt; ''Ruby'' refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.

Color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties, like '''lilac''' and '''fawn''',&lt;ref name="ratgen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrma.org/ratgenpart3.htm|title=Rat Genetics, part 3|first=Nichole|last=Royer|publisher=AFRMA|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between (and even within) different countries or clubs.&lt;ref name=afrma-std&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrma.org/fancyrm.htm|title=American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association standards|publisher=AFRMA|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carol&gt;{{cite book|title=Rats|last=Daly|first=Carol H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7aNn84hsNs8C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=international+rat+standard#PPA15,M1|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|year=2002|isbn=0-7641-2012-3|edition=2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nfrs-std&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfrs.org/varieties.html|title=National Fancy Rat Society standards|publisher=NFRS|accessdate=21 November 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209133238/http://www.nfrs.org/varieties.html|archivedate=9 December 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Markings ===
[[File:Rat siamese.JPG|thumb|&lt;!-- Do not change to Siamese, the picture is misnamed --&gt;Himalayan rats have a unique color and marking variation.]]

Further dividing the varieties of fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically in reference to the patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a '''self''' (completely solid, non-white color) and a '''Himalayan''' (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called [[Point coloration|points]], as in a [[Himalayan cat]]'s markings).&lt;ref name="rsa-standards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ratsocietyofamerica.org/standards2.html|title=Standards|publisher=Rat Society of America|accessdate=3 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126204510/http://ratsocietyofamerica.org/standards2.html|archivedate=26 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markings have a strict standard, with detailed terminology, for showing in fancy rat [[pet show]]s. However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard; many of those found in pet shops will have ''mismarkings'' from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a [[breed standard]] published by a rat fancier organisation.

Commonly recognized standards include:
* '''Berkshire''' – colored top, white belly
* '''Hooded''' – color runs in a ''saddle'', a single, unbroken line from full head down the spine and possibly partly down the tail&lt;ref name=nfrs-std /&gt;
* '''Capped''' – color on full head only
* '''Blazed''' – Colored head (Capped) or body (Irish, Berkshire or self), with a triangular wedge of white fur over the face.
* '''Variegated''' – Any form of mismatched, oddities in fur. Can be anything from broken or spotted hood or a misshaped blaze.
* '''Irish''' or '''English Irish''' – In England, the Irish is standardized by the NFRS as an [[equilateral triangle]] of white with a side that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid length.&lt;ref name=nfrs-std /&gt; In the United States and elsewhere, clubs like the AFRMA distinguish this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized Irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside.&lt;ref name=afrma-std /&gt;&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Susan|title=The Guide to Owning a Rat|publisher=TFH Publications|date=August 1997|page=12|isbn=0-7938-2157-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other marking varieties include '''spotted''' or '''Dalmatian''' (named for the spotted [[Dalmatian dog]]), '''essex''', '''masked''', and '''Siamese''' (typically a [[gradient]] of color along the body, darkest at the base of the tail and nose as in [[Siamese cat]]s), and '''[[Downunder rat|downunder]]''' or downunders (an Australian variety which has a solid color stripe on the belly or a color marking there that corresponds to markings on top).&lt;ref name="rmfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemberg|first=Yvette|author2=Cindy Sautchuk|year=2000|title=A New Rat Variety Down Under|journal=Rat and Mouse Fancy Report|publisher=Rat and Mouse Fanciers for Excellence (RMFE)|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://rodentfancy.com/pets/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/downundr.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clear}}

=== Body type ===
[[File:Velvet small.jpg|thumb|right|A male Dumbo rat, a variety with ears placed lower on the head.]]
Two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx and Dumbo. The '''Dumbo''', whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for resemblance to the fictional [[Dumbo]] the Elephant. The '''Manx''' rat is tailless due to a [[genetic mutation]], and was named for the [[Manx cat]], which shares this feature,&lt;ref name=afrma-std /&gt; though not necessarily due to the same mutation.

=== Coat types ===
There is a relatively small variety of coats in relation to the number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the '''normal''' or '''standard''', which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer.&lt;ref name=afrma-std /&gt;&lt;ref name=nfrs-std /&gt; Other standardized coats include: '''rex''', in which all the hairs are curly, even the [[Vibrissae|whiskers]]; '''velveteen''', a softer variation of the rex; '''satin''' or '''silky''' coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and '''Harley'''&lt;!--If this is not named after someone identifiable, it should not be capitalised--&gt;, characterized by wispy long straight hairs.&lt;ref name=afrma-std /&gt;&lt;ref name=nfrs-std /&gt;&lt;ref name=ratspacnw-std&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratspacnw.org/rat%20standards.htm|title=Rats PacNW standards|publisher=RatsPacNW Rat Fanciers Club|accessdate=12 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427192925/http://www.ratspacnw.org/rat%20standards.htm|archivedate=27 April 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as '''hairless''' rats.

==== Hairless rats ====
[[File:Hairless rat Lhassa.jpg|thumb|Even though this rat is hairless, [[pigmentation]] indicates that it is a hooded rat.]]

{{See also|Laboratory rat#Hairless rats|l1=Hairless laboratory rats}}

Hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss. Hairless rats, bred from curly-coated rexes, range from having areas of very short fur to being completely bare. Hairless rats are genetically produced by breeding different combinations of the genes that cause Rex coats. Since rex is a [[dominant trait]], there only needs to be one rex parent to produce curly rex-coated offspring. However, when two copies of the trait are present, by breeding two rexes together, the coat is affected differently—causing hairlessness, and earning the colloquial name, "double-rex". One subset of semi-hairless rats, Patchwork rats, constantly lose hair and regrow it in different "patches" several times throughout their life.&lt;ref name=afrma-std /&gt;&lt;ref name=nfrs-std /&gt;It is usually not advised to keep Hairless Rats outside of laboratories when they are required for research as they are subject to a plethora of health problems such as kidney and liver failure, as well as many skin conditions and dramatically shortened life span.

=== Ethics of selective breeding ===
There is controversy among rat fanciers in regard to selective breeding.&lt;ref name="nfrs-breeding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfrs.org/geninfo.html|title=General Information – Advice for the Novice Breeder|date=3 May 2008|publisher=National Fancy Rat Society|accessdate=14 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909021538/http://www.nfrs.org/geninfo.html|archivedate=9 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rmca-breeding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmca.org/Articles/breeding.htm|title=Breeding: Can YOU Live With It?|last=Isaksen|first=Mary Ann|date=January 1999|work=Rat &amp; Mouse Gazette|publisher=Rat &amp; Mouse Club of America|accessdate=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, breeding rats to "conform" to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of [[#History|what the fancy was founded on]]. On the other hand, the process results in many rats who do not "conform", and are then either given away, sold as food, or killed—referred to as [[culling]].

There are concerns as to whether breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]. Tailless rats have greater risk of [[Hyperthermia|heat exhaustion]], poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can be at risk for life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and [[megacolon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrma.org/taillessrats.htm|title=Tailless Rats|last=Royer|first=Nichole|year=1998|work=AFRMA Rat &amp; Mouse Tales|publisher=American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association|accessdate=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the [[National Fancy Rat Society|NFRS]] prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfrs.org/banned.html|title=Banned varieties|publisher=The National Fancy Rat Society|accessdate=11 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018171106/http://www.nfrs.org/banned.html|archivedate=18 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ''[[R. norvegicus]]'' and related species are seen as pests, their intentional import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in [[Invasive species in Australia|Australia]],&lt;ref name="aqis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/cat-dogs/other |title=Other Pets – DAFF |publisher=Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service |accessdate=3 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225171457/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/cat-dogs/other |archivedate=25 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of [[Alberta]], which is considered rat-free,&lt;ref name="Bourne"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourne|first=John|title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta|work=Agriculture and Food|publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture|date=1 October 2002|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441|accessdate=1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.&lt;ref name="Bourne" /&gt;

[[File:Brown hooded rat with a large tumor.jpg|thumb|Fancy rats of both sexes commonly develop mammary tumors as they age. These are usually benign, but multiple tumors can persist even after removal.&lt;ref name=merck-neoplasia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171562.htm|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Neoplasia|accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Human-raised ''[[R. norvegicus]]'' are more prone to specific health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts, but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild. The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living conditions, and diet.

Rats that live their entire lives indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing bacteria such as [[Salmonellosis|''Salmonella'']] and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of [[endemic typhus]] and intestinal parasites like the [[Hymenolepiasis|Rat tapeworm]].&lt;ref name="merck-skin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171546.htm|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Skin Diseases|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merck-gastro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171544.htm|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Gastrointestinal Diseases|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.

While living indoors decreases the risk of contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health to make them more prone to specific conditions.&lt;ref name="merck-skin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merck-manage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171543.htm|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Management|quote=Ambient temperatures &amp;gt;85°F (29.4°C), high humidity levels (&amp;gt;80%), poor ventilation, and overcrowding predispose rodents to heat exhaustion.|accessdate=7 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171548.htm|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Reproductive Diseases|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Tyzzer's disease]], protozoic infections (e.g. ''Giardia muris''), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats.&lt;ref name="merck-gastro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merck-resp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171545.htm|title=Merck Veterinary Manual – Respiratory Diseases|accessdate=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, pet rats are exposed to ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', a [[zoonotic]] disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with [[strep throat]]. A human-associated fungus, ''[[Pneumocystis carinii]]'' (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's [[immune system]] is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name="merck-resp" /&gt;

Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), [[Sendai virus]], and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, ''[[Mycoplasma|Mycoplasma pulmonis]]''), are prevalent simply because their highly contagious natures work in tandem with the way rats are kept in laboratories, [[pet store]]s, and by breeders.&lt;ref name="merck-gastro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merck-resp" /&gt; It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.&lt;ref name="merck-resp" /&gt;

Pet rats can also develop [[Pituitary adenoma|pituitary tumors]] if they are given high-calorie diets,&lt;ref name="merck-neoplasia" /&gt; and [[ringtail (disease)|ringtail]] if they are placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures.&lt;ref name="ratguide-health"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ratguide.com/health/integumentary_skin/ringtail.php|title=Health Guide- Ringtail|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside on the top of the skin, but cuts and scratches from [[social animal|social]] and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause [[ulcerative dermatitis]].&lt;ref name="merck-skin" /&gt;

There is some evidence that spayed female rats ("does") are less likely to develop mammary and pituitary tumors than non-spayed females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ratfanclub.org/spay.html|title=the Rat Report|website=www.ratfanclub.org|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into prevention of common diseases and health issues in rats is on-going. Dietary changes are among the main suggestions for improved health and longevity in fancy rats, such suggestions included are feeding rat-friendly superfoods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ratcentral.com/superfoods-for-rats/|title=11 Superfoods To Add To Your Rats Diet – RatCentral|website=RatCentral|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in moderation to reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease and stroke.

=== Risks to owners ===

Keeping rats as pets can come with the stigma that rats supposedly transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One fear is that all rats carry [[plague (disease)|plague]], when in fact ''R. norvegicus'' is not among the list of species considered a threat.&lt;ref name="JAVMA" /&gt; In 2004, an outbreak of [[salmonella]] in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5417a3.htm|title=Outbreak of Multidrug-Resistant Salmonella Typhimurium Associated with Rodents Purchased at Retail Pet Stores|date=May 6, 2005|publisher=[[Center for Disease Control]]|accessdate=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, along with many other zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to ''wild'' rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.&lt;ref name="merck-general" /&gt;

Another risk to rat owners is [[Rat-bite fever]]. This is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2017, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported an outbreak of [[Seoul virus]] spread by pet rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/outbreaks/seoul-virus/index.html|title=Multi-state Outbreak of Seoul Virus|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, pet brown rats are often depicted as [[Tame animal#Taming versus domestication|''tamed'' rather than ''domesticated'']], akin to when a character befriends a [[gray wolf|wolf]].

The '''domestic pig''' (''Sus scrofa domesticus'' or only ''Sus domesticus''), often called '''swine''', '''hog''', or simply '''pig''' when there is no need to distinguish it from other [[pig]]s, is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] large, [[even-toed ungulate]]. It is variously considered a [[subspecies]] of the [[wild boar]] or a distinct [[species]]. The domestic pig's head-plus-body-length ranges from {{convert|0.9|to|1.8|m|in|abbr=on}}, and the adult can weigh between {{convert|50|and|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Compared to other [[artiodactyl]]s, its head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. Even-toed ungulates are generally [[herbivore|herbivorous]], but the domestic pig is an [[omnivore]], like its wild relative.

When used as [[livestock]], domestic pigs are [[Pig farming|farmed]] primarily for the consumption of their flesh, called [[pork]]. The animal's bones, hide, and [[bristles]] are also used in commercial products. Domestic pigs, especially [[Miniature pig|miniature]] breeds, are kept as pets.

==Biology==
[[File:Domestic pig skull.jpeg|thumb|Domestic pig skull]][[File:Suíno alta.jpg|thumb|right|Skeleton specimen of a swine]]
[[File:Pig hand skeleton.jpg|thumb|left|Bones of a domestic pig’s foot]]
The domestic pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of [[cartilage]] at the tip.&lt;ref name="ADW Sus scrofa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Sus_scrofa.html|title=Sus scrofa (wild boar)|website=Animal Diversity Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food, and is a very acute sense organ. The [[dental formula]] of adult pigs is {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.3|lower=3.1.4.3}}, giving a total of 44 [[tooth|teeth]]. The rear teeth are adapted for crushing. In the male the canine teeth can form [[tusk]]s, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.&lt;ref name="ADW Sus scrofa"/&gt;

Four [[hoof]]ed toes are on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunnersden.com/index.htm.shooting-hunting-hogs.html|title=American Wild Game / Feral Pigs / Hogs / Pigs / Wild Boar:|first=Kim|last=Lockhart|website=www.gunnersden.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most domestic pigs have rather a [[bristle]]d sparse hair covering on their skin, although [[wool|woolly-coated]] breeds such as the [[Mangalitsa]] exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malverngazette.co.uk/mostpopular.var.1476623.mostviewed.royal_visit_delights_at_the_three_counties_show.php|title=Royal visit delights at the Three Counties Show|website=Malvern Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs possess both [[apocrine sweat gland|apocrine]] and [[eccrine sweat gland]]s, although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas.&lt;ref name="Sumena et al., (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sumena | first1 = K.B. | last2 = Lucy | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Chungath | first3 = J.J. | last4 = Ashok | first4 = N. | last5 = Harshan | first5 = K.R. | year = 2010 | title = Regional histology of the subcutaneous tissue and the sweat glands of large white Yorkshire pigs | url = http://www.tanuvas.tn.nic.in/tnjvas/vol6(3)/128-135.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Tamilnadu Journal of Veterinary and Animal Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 128–135 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pigs, however, like other "hairless" mammals (e.g. elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling.&lt;ref name="Folk and Semken, (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Folk | first1 = G.E. | last2 = Semken | first2 = H.A. | year = 1991 | title = The evolution of sweat glands | url = | journal = International Journal of Biometeorology | volume = 35 | issue = 3| pages = 180–186 | doi=10.1007/bf01049065}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet [[mucous membrane]]s in the mouth through panting. Their [[Thermal neutral zone|thermoneutral]] zone is 16 to 22&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/04/22/2223974.htm|title=Sweat like a pig?|date=22 April 2008|website=www.abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by [[Wallowing in animals|wallowing]] in mud or water via evaporative cooling; although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, [[Parasitism|ecto-parasite]] control, and scent-marking.&lt;ref name="Bracke, (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bracke | first1 = M.B.M. | year = 2011 | title = Review of wallowing in pigs: Description of the behaviour and its motivational basis | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 132 | issue = 1| pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] that protect against snake venom. [[Mongoose]]s, [[honey badger]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the [[snake venom]] [[Snake venom#Neurotoxins|α-neurotoxin]] from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drabeck|first1=D.H.|last2=Dean|first2=A.M.|last3=Jansa|first3=S.A.|title=Why the honey badger don't care: Convergent evolution of venom-targeted nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in mammals that survive venomous snake bites|journal=Toxicon|date=1 June 2015|volume=99|pages=68–72|doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2015.03.007|pmid=25796346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size, and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal [[bronchitis]] and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pigs.org/article.asp?article_id=3|title=Pros and Cons of Potbellied Pigs|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317221208/http://www.pigs.org/article.asp?article_id=3|archivedate=17 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The domestic pig is most often considered to be a [[subspecies]] of the [[wild boar]], which was given the name ''Sus scrofa'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the domestic pig is ''Sus scrofa domesticus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?name=Sus+scrofa+domestica|title=Taxonomy Browser|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gentry"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthea Gentry |author2=Juliet Clutton-Brock |author3=Colin P.

He gave it the name ''Sus domesticus'', which is still used by some taxonomists.&lt;ref&gt;Corbet and Hill (1992), referred to in {{MSW3|id=14200054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gentry2"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthea Gentry|author2=Juliet Clutton-Brock|author3=Colin P.

[[DNA]] evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6978203.stm BBC News, "Pig DNA reveals farming history"] 4 September 2007.

In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included a mixture with a now extinct [[ghost population]] of wild pigs during the [[Pleistocene]]. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=frantz2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frantz, L|year=2015|title=Evidence of long-term gene flow and selection during domestication from analyses of Eurasian wild and domestic pig genomes|doi=10.1038/ng.3394|pmid=26323058|volume=47|issue=10|journal=Nat.

The adaptable nature and [[omnivorous]] diet of the wild boar allowed early humans to domesticate it readily. Pigs were mostly used for food, but early civilizations also used the pigs' hides for shields, bones for tools and weapons, and bristles for brushes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flossybrush.ca/oral.html Oral Care.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916014320/http://www.flossybrush.ca/oral.html |date=16 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, pigs have been domesticated for a long time, mostly in [[Goa]] and some [[rural area]]s, for [[pig toilet]]s.

Among the animals that the Spanish [[Columbian Exchange|introduced]] to the [[Chiloé Archipelago]] in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt.

== Reproduction ==
Female pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age, and come into [[Estrous cycle|estrus]] every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred. The gestation period averages 112–120 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/63668/feral-hog-reproductive-biology|title=Feral Hog Reproductive Biology|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat. Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar. [[Androstenol]] is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G2312|title=G2312 Artificial Insemination in Swine: Breeding the Female {{!}} University of Missouri Extension|last=|first=|date=|website=extension.missouri.edu|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livestocktrail.illinois.edu/swinerepronet/paperDisplay.cfm?ContentID=6274|title=The Female - Swine Reproduction|last=|first=|date=|website=livestocktrail.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have [[bicornuate uterus]]es and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bazer | first1 = F.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Yorkshire pigs at animal sanctuary.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic pigs in a wallow]]
In many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of other [[artiodactyls]] and of [[carnivora|carnivores]].&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;  Domestic pigs seek out the company of other pigs, and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds. They typically live in groups of about 8-10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algers|first=Bo|last2=Uvnäs-Moberg|first2=Kerstin|date=1 June 2007|title=Maternal behavior in pigs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X07000682|journal=Hormones and Behavior|series=Reproductive Behavior in Farm and Laboratory Animals11th Annual Meeting of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology|volume=52|issue=1|pages=78–85|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.022|pmid=17482189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They cover themselves from head to toe in mud.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most [[bristle]]d pigs will "blow their coat", meaning that they shed most of the longer, more-coarse stiff hair once a year, usually in [[Spring (season)|Spring]] or early [[Summer]], to prepare for the warmer months ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/educational/blowing-coat-mini-pig-shedding|title=Blowing Coat - Mini Pig Shedding FAQ|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If conditions permit, domestic pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to [[ruminants]] which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time. Pigs are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour. As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kongsted|first=A. G.|last2=Horsted|first2=K.|last3=Hermansen|first3=J.

=== Rooting ===

"Rooting" is an instinctual behavior in pigs that is characterized by a pig nudging its snout into something. Similar to a [[Kneading (cats)|cat’s kneading]], rooting is found comforting, first happens when they are born in order to obtain their mother’s [[milk]], and can become a habitual, obsessive behavior which is most prominent in animals [[Weaning|weaned]] too early. Often, pigs will root and dig into the ground to forage for food. Rooting is known to also be used as a means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/educational/rooting-behaviors-in-mini-pigs|title=Rooting &amp; Nudging Behaviors in Mini Pigs|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pig may be chosen to have a [[nose ring (animals)#Pig nose rings|nose ring]] pierced through its septum, as this discourages rooting as it is painful to the pig. Piercing through the rim of the nose is even more painful, as in this area, there are many more [[free nerve ending]]s.

===Nest-building===
A behavioural characteristic of domestic pigs which they share with carnivores is [[nest-building]]. Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth. First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body. She then collects twigs, grasses and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound. She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet. When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface. She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material. She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)" /&gt;

Nest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour. Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing, and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Algers|first=Bo|last2=Uvnäs-Moberg|first2=Kerstin|date=1 June 2007|title=Maternal behavior in pigs|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=52|issue=1|pages=78–85|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.03.022|issn=0018-506X|pmid=17482189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nest-building is divided into two phases: one of which is the initial phase of rooting in ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil. This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation. The nest will provide protection against weather and predators, while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd. This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wischner D., Kemper N., and Krieter J. 2009. "Nest-building behaviour in sows and consequences for pig husbandry". ''Livestock Science.'' 124(1): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli. Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin.

===Nursing and suckling behaviour===
[[File:PigCochon allaitant.jpg|thumb|right|A sow with suckling piglets]] 
Compared to most other mammals, pigs display complex nursing and suckling behaviour.&lt;ref name="Fraser, (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = D | year = 1980 | title = A review of the behavioural mechanisms of milk ejection of the domestic pig | url = | journal = Applied Animal Ethology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 247–256 | doi=10.1016/0304-3762(80)90026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nursing occurs every 50–60 minutes, and the sow requires stimulation from piglets before milk let-down. Sensory inputs (vocalisation, odours from mammary and birth fluids and hair patterns of the sow) are particularly important immediately post-birth to facilitate teat location by the piglets.&lt;ref name="Rohde Parfet and Gonyou, (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rohde Parfet | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Gonyou | first2 = H.W. | year = 1991 | title = Attraction of newborn piglets to auditory, visual, olfactory and tactile stimuli | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 125–133 | doi=10.2527/1991.691125x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the piglets compete for position at the udder, then each piglet massages around its respective teat with its snout, during which time the sow grunts at slow, regular intervals. Each series of grunts varies in frequency, tone and magnitude, indicating the stages of nursing to the piglets.&lt;ref name="Algers, (1993)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Algers | first1 = B | year = 1993 | title = Nursing in pigs: communicating needs and distributing resources | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14973674 | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 71 | issue = 10| pages = 2826–2831 | doi=10.2527/1993.71102826x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase of competition for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute, and ends when milk flow begins. In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats in their mouths and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), and the rate of the sow’s grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds. The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with milk ejection, but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="Castren et al., (1989)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Castren | first1 = H. | last2 = Algers | first2 = B. | last3 = Jensen | first3 = P. | last4 = Saloniemi | first4 = H. | year = 1989 | title = Suckling behaviour and milk consumption in newborn piglets as a response to sow grunting | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 227–238 | doi=10.1016/0168-1591(89)90069-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10–20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second. The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase. Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow. The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder. Piglets massage and suckle the sow’s teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status. This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings. The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.&lt;ref name="Jensen et al., (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = P. | last2 = Gustafsson | first2 = G. | last3 = Augustsson | first3 = H. | year = 1998 | title = Massaging after milk ejection in domestic pigs - an example of honest begging? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 779–786 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0651| pmid = 9632466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teat order===
In pigs, [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. Domestic piglets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"/&gt;  Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing milk letdown,&lt;ref name="Fraser, (1973)"&gt;Fraser, D., (1973). The nursing and suckling behaviour in pigs. I. The importance of stimulation of the anterior teats. British Veterinary Journal, 129: 324-336&lt;/ref&gt; so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.
Using an artificial sow to rear groups of piglets, recognition of a teat in a particular area of the udder depended initially on visual orientation by means of reference points on the udder to find the area, and then the olfactory sense for the more accurate search within that area.&lt;ref name="Jeppesen, (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeppesen | first1 = L.E. | year = 1982 | title = Teat-order in groups of piglets reared on an artificial sow. II.

===Senses===
Pigs have [[Panorama|panoramic]] vision of approximately 310° and [[binocular vision]] of 35° to 50°. It is thought they have no [[Accommodation (eye)|eye accommodation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3e.htm|title=Animalbehaviour.net (Pigs)|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317194223/http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3e.htm|archivedate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other animals that have no accommodation, e.g. sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3b.htm|title=Animalbehaviour.net (Sheep)|accessdate=9 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226191014/http://animalbehaviour.net/JudithKBlackshaw/Chapter3b.htm|archivedate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent to which pigs have colour vision is still a source of some debate; however, the presence of [[cone cell]]s in the retina with two distinct wavelength sensitivities (blue and green) suggests that at least some colour vision is present.&lt;ref name="Lomas et al., 1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lomas | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Piggins | first2 = D. | last3 = Phillips | first3 = C.J.C. | year = 1998 | title = Visual awareness | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 57 | issue = 3–4| pages = 247–257 | doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(98)00100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs have a well-developed sense of smell, and use is made of this in [[Europe]] where they are trained to locate underground [[truffles]]. Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs.&lt;ref name="Houpt, (1998)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., (1998). Domestic Animal Behavior for Veterinarians and Animal Scientists. 3rd edition. Iowa State University Press, Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hearing is also well developed, and localisation of sounds is made by moving the head.

In "Social Behaviour in Farm Animals", eds. Keeling, L.J. and Gonyou, H.W. CABI, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Vieuille-Thomas and Signoret, (1992)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vieuille-Thomas | first1 = C. | last2 = Signoret | first2 = J.P. | year = 1992 | title = Pheromonal transmission of an aversive experience in domestic pigs | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 18 | issue = 9| pages = 1551–1557 | doi=10.1007/bf00993228| pmid = 24254286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.&lt;ref name="Jensen and Redbo, (1987)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = P. | last2 = Redbo | first2 = I. | year = 1987 | title = Behaviour during nest leaving in free ranging domestic pigs | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 18 | issue = 3–4| pages = 355–362 | doi=10.1016/0168-1591(87)90229-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeds==
{{Main|List of pig breeds}}

Many [[breed]]s of domestic pig exist; in many colors, shapes, and sizes. According to [[The Livestock Conservancy]], as of 2016, three breeds of domestic pig are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000). They are the [[Choctaw hog]], the [[Mulefoot]], and the [[Ossabaw Island pig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livestockconservancy.org/index.php/heritage/internal/conservation-priority-list#Pigs|title=The Livestock Conservancy|last=|first=|date=|website=livestockconservancy.org|language=en|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The known smallest domestic pig breed in the world is the [[Göttingen minipig]], typically weighing about {{convert|26|kg|lb}} as a healthy, full-grown adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://minipigs.dk/fileadmin/filer/pdf/Taking_good_care_of_Ellegaard_Goettingen_Minipigs_13.03.13.pdf |title=Taking good care of Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs® |website=Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs |access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Show_Pig_(18097041013).jpg|thumb|A [[Large White pig|Large White]], a breed commonly used in meat production]]
When in use as [[livestock]], the domestic pig is mostly farmed for its meat, [[pork]]. Other food products made from pigs include pork [[sausage]] (which includes [[casing (sausage)|casing]]s that are made from the [[intestine]]s), [[bacon]], [[Gammon (meat)|gammon]], [[ham]] and [[pork rinds]]. The head of a pig can be used to make a preserved jelly called [[head cheese]], which is sometimes known as brawn. [[Liver (food)|Liver]], [[chitterlings]], [[blood (food)|blood]] (for [[black pudding]]), and other [[offal]] from pigs are also widely used for food. In some [[religion]]s, such as [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]], pork is a [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|taboo food]].

The use of [[pig milk]] for human consumption does take place, but as there are certain difficulties in obtaining it, there is little commercial production.

Livestock pigs are exhibited at [[agricultural show]]s, judged either as [[Stud (animal)|stud stock]] compared to the standard features of each pig breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat.

The [[Leather|skin of pigs]] is used to produce seat covers, apparel, [[pork rinds]], and other items.

In some [[developing nation|developing]] and [[developed nation]]s, the domestic pig is usually raised outdoors in yards or fields. In some areas, pigs are allowed to [[foraging|forage]] in woods where they may be taken care of by [[swineherd]]s. In [[industrialization|industrialized]] nations such as the United States, domestic pig farming has switched from the [[Sty|traditional pig farm]] to large-scale [[intensive pig farming|intensive pig farms]]. This has resulted in lower production costs, but can cause significant [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] problems, and demand for pasture-raised pork in the United States has increased as consumers become concerned with humane treatment of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/business/demand-grows-for-hogs-that-are-raised-humanely.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Demand Grows for Hogs That Are Raised Humanely Outdoors|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As pets==
[[File:Mini pig 2.jpg|thumb|right|Crossbred miniature pig #1]] 
[[Vietnamese Pot-bellied|Vietnamese pot-bellied pig]]s, a [[miniature pig|small breed of domestic pig]], have made popular [[pet]]s in the [[United States]] beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century.

They were soon crossbred with a variety of other smaller breeds (such as the [[Göttingen minipig]]), with separate locations breeding different lineages. These [[miniature pig]]s soon gained attention, even more so than the original [[Vietnamese Pot-bellied|Vietnamese pot-bellied]]. As a result of this, many pet pigs are now of unknown genetic descent.

Domestic pigs are highly [[intelligent]], social creatures. They are considered hypoallergenic, and are known to do quite well with people who have usual animal allergies. Since these animals are known to have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, they require long-term commitment.

===Care===

Un-neutered male and female swine may express unwanted, aggressive behavior, and are prone to developing serious health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/owners/helpful-owner-articles/spay-and-neuter|title=Spay and Neuter - American Mini Pig Association|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular trimming of the hooves is necessary; hooves left untreated cause major pain in the pig, can create malformations in bone structure, and may cause it to be more susceptible to fungal growth between crevices of the hoof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanminipigassociation.com/owners/helpful-owner-articles/hoof-trimming|title=Hoof Trimming - American Mini Pig Association|website=americanminipigassociation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As prey animals, natural behavior causes pigs to have a strong fear of being picked up, but they will usually calm down once placed back onto the ground. When holding the pig, supporting it under the legs is not as stressful for the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifewithaminipig.com/how-to-hold-a-mini-pig|title=Mini Pig Training: How to Hold a Mini Pig - Life with a Mini Pig|date=21 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pigs need enrichment activities to keep their intelligent minds occupied; if pigs get bored, they often get destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minipiginfo.com/aggressive-mini-pigs.html|title=Aggressive Mini Pigs- How To Correct Aggression Issues|website=Mini Pig Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[#Rooting|rooting]] is found to be comforting, pigs kept in the house may root in household objects, and as such, should have a box with rocks, soil, straw, and/or other material for them to root in instead.

==In human healthcare==
The domestic pig, both as a live animal and source of post-mortem tissues, is one of the most valuable animal models used in biomedical research today, because of its biological, physiological and anatomical similarities to human beings.&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu/&gt;&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu2/&gt; For instance, human skin is very similar to pig skin, therefore pig skin has been used in many preclinical studies.&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ivis.org/proceedings/acvp/2009/Herron.pdf?LA=1 | title = Pigs as Dermatologic Models of Human Skin Disease | last = Herron | first = Alan J. | date = 5 December 2009 | website = ivis.org | publisher = DVM Center for Comparative Medicine and Department of Pathology Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas | access-date = 27 January 2018 | quote = pig skin has been shown to be the most similar to human skin. Pig skin is structurally similar to human epidermal thickness and dermal-epidermal thickness ratios. Pigs and humans have similar hair follicle and blood vessel patterns in the skin. Biochemically pigs contain dermal collagen and elastic content that is more similar to humans than other laboratory animals. Finally pigs have similar physical and molecular responses to various growth factors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=porcine2018Janu2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sinclairresearch.com/assets/25_Wound-Healing-AALAS-2009.pdf | title = Comparison of Human, Porcine and Rodent Wound Healing With New Miniature Swine Study Data | last = Liu, J., Kim, D., Brown, L., Madsen, T., Bouchard, G.

They are also used in the development of medical instruments and devices, surgical techniques and instrumentation, and FDA-approved research. As part of animal conservation ([[The Three Rs (animals)]]), these animals contribute to the reduction methods for animal research, as they supply more information from fewer animals used, for a lower cost.

===Xenotransplantation===
{{Main|Xenotransplantation}}

Pigs are currently thought to be the best non-human candidates for organ donation to humans. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Warrens | first2 = A. N. | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.96.3.111 | title = Xenotransplantation: Where are we today? | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 111–117 | year = 2003 | pmc = 539416 | pmid=12612110}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are readily available, their organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations.&lt;ref name=Taylor2007&gt;Taylor, L. (2007) [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3715.htm Xenotransplantation]. Emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s [[immune system]]—generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and in some cases result in the death of the recipient—including hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection and chronic rejection. An early major breakthrough was the 1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockout.&lt;ref name=latemple&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D. C. | last2 = Galili | first2 = U. | title = Adult and neonatal anti-Gal response in knock-out mice for alpha1,3galactosyltransferase | journal = Xenotransplantation | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–196 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9741457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine [[herpesvirus]], [[rotavirus]], [[parvovirus]], and [[circovirus]]. Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.&lt;ref name=FDA2006&gt;FDA. (2006) [http://www.fda.gov/cber/xap/xap.htm Xenotransplantation Action Plan: FDA Approach to the Regulation of Xenotransplantation]. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using [[CRISPR#Editing|CRISPR Cas9 genome editing]] technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=NY Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/science/editing-of-pig-dna-may-lead-to-more-organs-for-people.html?_r=1 | author = Carl Zimmerman | title=Editing of Pig DNA May Lead to More Organs for People | date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mule''' is the [[offspring]] of a male [[donkey]] (jack) and a female horse ([[mare]]).&lt;ref name=LOCMuleDay&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-12-18 |title=Mule Day: A Local Legacy |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/tn/es_tn_mule_1.html |website=americaslibrary.gov |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedonkeysanctuary.org.uk/about-donkeys/mule|website=The Donkey Sanctuary|title=What is a mule?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horse]]s and donkeys are different species, with different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. Of the two [[F1 hybrid]]s (first generation hybrids) between these two species, a mule is easier to obtain than a [[hinny]], which is the offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion).

The size of a mule and work to which it is put depend largely on the breeding of the mule's female parent ([[Mare|dam]]). Mules can be lightweight, medium weight or when produced from [[draft horse]] mares, of moderately heavy weight.&lt;ref name=Ensminger85&gt;{{cite book |last=Ensminger |first=M.

==Biology==
The mule is valued because, while it has the size and ground-covering ability of its dam, it is stronger than a horse of similar size and inherits the endurance and disposition of the [[donkey]] sire, tending to require less food than a horse of similar size. Mules also tend to be more independent than most domesticated equines other than its parental species, the donkey.

The median weight range for a mule is between about {{convert|370|and|460|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Mule | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g50MAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15 | encyclopedia = The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General | volume = XVII | pages = 15 | publisher = Henry G. Allen and Company | year = 1888 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While a few mules can carry live weight up to {{convert|160|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, the superiority of the mule becomes apparent in their additional endurance.&lt;ref name=Carlton/&gt;

In general, a mule can be packed with dead weight of up to 20% of its body weight, or approximately {{convert|90|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=Carlton&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009 |title=Hunter's Specialties: More With Wayne Carlton On Elk Hunting |url=http://hunterspec.com/content/more-wayne-carlton-elk-hunting |website=hunterspec.com |publisher=Hunter's Specialties|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008150241/http://hunterspec.com/Updateable/update_display.cfm?pageID=2048&amp;categoryID=12 |archivedate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it depends on the individual animal, it has been reported that mules trained by the [[Army of Pakistan]] can carry up to {{convert|72|kg|lbs|0}} and walk {{convert|26|km|mi|1}} without resting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Aamer Ahmed |date=2005-10-19 |title=Beasts ease burden of quake victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4354440.stm |newspaper= |location= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The average equine in general can carry up to approximately 30% of its body weight in live weight, such as a rider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|title=Chapter 3, Section IV: Size|author=American Endurance Ride Conference|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=November 2003|work=Endurance Rider's Handbook|publisher=AERC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515133147/http://www.aerc.org/AERC_Rider_Handbook110303.asp|archivedate=2008-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female mule that has [[estrus]] cycles and thus, in theory, could carry a fetus, is called a "molly" or "Molly mule", though the term is sometimes used to refer to female mules in general.  Pregnancy is rare, but can occasionally occur naturally as well as through [[embryo transfer]]. A male mule is properly called a ''horse mule'', though often called a ''john mule'', which is the correct term for a [[Gelding|gelded]] mule. A young male mule is called a ''mule colt'', and a young female is called a ''mule filly''.&lt;ref name=LongearLingo&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-05-22 |title=Longear Lingo |url=http://www.lovelongears.com/longearlingo.html |website=lovelongears.com |publisher=American Donkey and Mule Society |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
With its short thick head, long ears, thin limbs, small narrow hooves, and short [[mane (horse)|mane]], the mule shares characteristics of a donkey. In height and body, shape of neck and [[Rump (animal)|rump]], uniformity of coat, and teeth, it appears horse-like. The mule comes in all sizes, shapes and [[Equine conformation|conformations]]. There are mules that resemble huge draft horses, sturdy [[American quarter horse|quarter horses]], fine-boned racing horses, shaggy [[pony|ponies]] and more.

The mule is an example of [[hybrid vigor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Chen |editor1-first=Z. Jeffrey |editor2-last=Birchler |editor2-first=James A. |year=2013 |title=Polyploid and Hybrid Genomics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rZmCf5ZvYUC&amp;lpg=PA137 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location= |page= |isbn=978-0-470-96037-0 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Darwin wrote: "The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature."&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |year=1879 |title=What Mr. Darwin Saw in His Voyage Round the World in the Ship 'Beagle' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GY41AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA33 |publisher=Harper &amp; Bros. |location=New York |pages=33–34 |isbn= |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mule inherits from its sire the traits of intelligence, sure-footedness, toughness, endurance, disposition, and natural cautiousness. From its dam it inherits speed, conformation, and agility.&lt;ref name=Hauer2014&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hauer |editor-first=John |year=2014 |title=The Natural Superiority of Mules |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVJlAgAAQBAJ |location= |publisher=Skyhorse |page= |isbn=978-1-62636-166-9 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6,8}} Mules are reputed to exhibit a higher cognitive intelligence than their parent species. That said, there is a lack of robust scientific evidence to back up these claims.  There is preliminary data from at least two evidence based studies, but they rely on [[sample size |a limited set of specialized cognitive tests and a small number of subjects]].&lt;ref name=MuleCognition/&gt;&lt;ref name=Giebel1958&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giebel et al. |date=1958 |title=Visuelles Lernvermögen bei Einhufern |journal=Zool. Jb |volume=67  |pages=487-520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mules are generally taller at the shoulder than donkeys and have better endurance than horses, although a lower top speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://purelyfacts.com/question/9/which-is-taller-a-mule-or-a-horse?DDA=77&amp;DDB=55 |website=Purelyfacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuleCognition&gt;{{cite journal |last=Proops |first=Leanne |author2=Faith Burden |author3=Britta Osthaus  |date=2008-07-18 |title=Mule cognition: a case of hybrid vigor? |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c7r42628738ll2h8/fulltext.pdf |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=75–84 |doi= 10.1007/s10071-008-0172-1 |pmid=18636282 |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handlers of [[working animal]]s generally find mules preferable to horses: mules show more patience under the pressure of heavy weights, and their skin is harder and less sensitive than that of horses, rendering them more capable of resisting sun and rain. Their hooves are harder than horses', and they show a natural resistance to disease and insects. Many North American farmers with [[clay]] soil found mules superior as plow animals.

A mule does not sound exactly like a donkey or a horse. Instead, a mule makes a sound that is similar to a donkey's but also has the whinnying characteristics of a horse (often starts with a whinny, ends in a hee-haw). Mules sometimes whimper.{{clear left}}

===Color and size variety===
[[File:Mules leisurely enjoying the sun and the snow.jpg|thumb|Mules come in a variety of colors and sizes; these mules had a draft horse mare for a mother]]
Mules come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors, from minis under {{convert|50|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} to maxis over {{convert|1000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, and in many different colors. The coats of mules come in the same varieties as those of horses. Common colors are [[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]], [[bay (horse)|bay]], [[black (horse)|black]], and [[gray (horse)|grey]]. Less common are [[white (horse)|white]], [[roan (horse)|roans]], [[palomino]], [[dun gene|dun]], and [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]]. Least common are [[pinto horse|paint]] mules or [[tobiano]]s. Mules from [[Appaloosa]] mares produce wildly colored mules, much like their Appaloosa horse relatives, but with even wilder skewed colors.  The Appaloosa color is produced by a complex of genes known as the [[Leopard complex]] (Lp). Mares homozygous for the Lp gene bred to any color donkey will produce a spotted mule.

===Distribution and use===
Mules historically were used by armies to transport supplies, occasionally as mobile firing platforms for smaller cannons, and to pull heavier field guns with wheels over mountainous trails such as in Afghanistan during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Caption of ''Mule Battery WDL11495.png'' Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) reports that [[China]] was the top market for mules in 2003, closely followed by [[Mexico]] and many [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]n nations.

==Fertility==
Mules and hinnies have 63 [[chromosome]]s, a mixture of the horse's 64 and the donkey's 62. The different structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos, rendering most mules infertile.

There are no recorded cases of fertile mule stallions. A few mare mules have produced offspring when mated with a purebred horse or donkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savory | first1 = Theodore H | year = 1970 | title = The Mule | journal = Scientific American | volume = 223 | issue = 6| pages = 102–109 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1270-102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kay2002&gt;{{cite news |last=Kay |first=Katty |date=2002-10-02 |title=Morocco's miracle mule |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2290491.stm |newspaper= |location= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] gives an account of such an event as an ill omen of [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|Xerxes' invasion of Greece]] in 480 BC: "There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis,—a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule" (Herodotus ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' 7:57), and a mule's giving birth was a frequently recorded portent in antiquity, although scientific writers also doubted whether the thing was really possible (see e.g. [[Aristotle]], ''Historia animalium'', 6.24; [[Varro]], ''De re rustica'', 2.1.28).

A 1939 article in the ''Journal of Heredity'' describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named "Old Bec", which was owned at the time by the A&amp;M College of Texas (now [[Texas A&amp;M University]])  in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike its mother, it was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited [[American Saddlebred|Saddlebred]] stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey.&lt;ref name=JHeredity-30-12&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=W.

== Modern usage ==
In the second half of the 20th century, widespread usage of mules declined in industrialized countries. The use of mules for farming and transportation of agricultural products largely gave way to steam then gasoline powered [[tractors]] and [[truck]]s. However, in the United States, a dedicated number of mule breeders continued the tradition as a hobby and continued breeding the great lines of [[American Mammoth Jack]]s started in the [[United States]] by [[George Washington]] with the gift from the King of Spain of two [[Zamorano-Leonés]] donkeys. These hobby breeders began to utilize better mares for mule production until today's modern saddle mule emerged. Exhibition shows where mules pulled heavy loads have now been joined with mules competing in [[Western riding|Western]] and [[English pleasure]] riding, as well as [[dressage]] and [[show jumping]] competition.  There is now a cable TV show dedicated to the training of donkeys and mules.  Mules, once snubbed at traditional horse shows, have been accepted for competition at the most exclusive horse shows in the world in all disciplines.

Mules are still used extensively to transport cargo in rugged roadless regions, such as the large [[wilderness]] areas of California's [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains or the [[Pasayten Wilderness]] of northern Washington state. Commercial pack mules are used recreationally, such as to supply mountaineering base camps, and also to supply trail building and maintenance crews, and backcountry footbridge building crews.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Louise A (2004).

Missoula, MT: Mountain Press. {{ISBN|0-87842-499-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, there are at least sixteen commercial mule [[pack station]]s in business in the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2009-01-18 |title=Members of the Eastern Sierra Packers |url=http://www.easternsierrapackers.com/members.htm |website=easternsierrapackers.com |publisher=Eastern Sierra Packers |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angeles chapter of the [[Sierra Club]] has a Mule Pack Section that organizes hiking trips with supplies carried by mules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014-04-18 |title=Mule Pack Section, Angeles Chapter, Sierra Club |url=http://angeles.sierraclub.org/mps/ |website=angeles.sierraclub.org |publisher=Angeles Chapter Sierra Club |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amish]] farmers, who reject tractors and most other modern technology for religious reasons, commonly use teams of six or eight mules to pull plows, [[disk harrow]]s, and other farm equipment, though they use horses for pulling buggies on the road.

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], the United States used large numbers of mules to carry weapons and supplies over Afghanistan's rugged terrain to the [[mujahideen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Bearden|Bearden, Milt]] (2003) ''The Main Enemy, The Inside story of the CIA's Final showdown with the KGB''. Presidio Press. {{ISBN|0345472500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of mules by U.S. forces has continued during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)]], and the [[United States Marine Corps]] has conducted an 11-day Animal Packers Course since the 1960s at its [[Mountain Warfare Training Center]] located in the Sierra Nevada near [[Bridgeport, California]].

[[File:There goes the Mexican railroad - p.078.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Mules provide [[bulk transport]] almost anywhere.]]
A '''mule train''' is a connected or unconnected line of '''pack mules''', usually carrying cargo. Because of the mule's ability to carry at least as much as a horse, their trait of being sure-footed along with their tolerance of poorer coarser foods and abilities to tolerate arid terrains, mule trains were common caravan organized means of [[animal power]]ed [[bulk transport]] back into pre-classical times. In many climate and circumstantial instances, an equivalent string of pack horses would have to carry more fodder and sacks of high energy grains such as [[oat]]s, so could carry less cargo. In modern times, strings of sure footed mules have been used to carry riders in dangerous but scenic back country terrain such as excursions into canyons.

Pack trains were instrumental in opening up the American West as the sure footed animals could carry up to {{convert|250|lb}}, survive on rough forage,{{efn |''Rough forage'' means mules, donkeys, and other asses, like many wild ungulates such as various deer species, can tolerate eating small shrubs, lichens and some branch-laden tree foliages and obtaining nutrition from such. In contrast, the digestive system of horses and to a lesser extent cattle are more dependent upon grasses, and evolved in climates where grasslands involved stands of grains and their high energy seed heads.}} did not require feed, and could operate in the arid higher elevations of the Rockies, serving as the main cargo means to the west from Missouri during the heyday of the [[North American fur trade]].{{efn |The influence and effect of fur trading, especially for [[beaver]] pelts between 1500–1940, is hard to understand these days when there are dozens of optional synthetic fabrics added to the repertoire of natural fiber materials. Many of the latter would only become widely available through the development of machinery processing ([[cotton gin]], [[spinning jenny]], etc.), making their use economical and widespread. The waterproof qualities of beaver hats and coats was valuable in the days when transportation measured the six miles per hour of horsebacked travel as rapid transit.}} Their use antedated the move west into the Rockies as colonial Americans sent out the first fur trappers and explorers past the Appalachians who were then followed west by high-risk-taking settlers by the 1750s (such as [[Daniel Boone]]) who led an increasing flood of emigrants that began pushing west over into southern New York, and through the [[gaps of the Allegheny]] into the [[Ohio Country]] (the lands of western [[colony of Virginia|Province of Virginia]] and the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]), into Tennessee and Kentucky before and especially after the [[American Revolution]].

Mule trains have been part of working portions of transportation links as recently as 2005 by the [[World Food Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mule train provides lifeline for remote quake survivors|url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/mule-train-provides-lifeline-remote-quake-survivors|website=www.wfp.org|publisher=World Food Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

In the nineteenth century, [[twenty-mule team]]s, for instance, were teams of eighteen mules and two horses attached to large wagons that ferried [[borax]] out of [[Death Valley]] from 1883 to 1889. The wagons were among the largest ever pulled by draft animals, designed to carry 10 [[short ton]]s (9 metric tons) of borax ore at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mules hauling a 22,000lb boiler|url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/exhibits/railroad/beginnings/muletrain.html|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clone ==
In 2003, researchers at [[University of Idaho]] and [[Utah State University]] produced the first mule [[cloning|clone]] as part of [[Project Idaho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Idaho |url=http://www.uidaho.edu/cloning |publisher=[[University of Idaho]] |date=2003-05-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809144746/http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/cloning |archivedate=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research team included Gordon Woods, professor of [[animal science|animal]] and [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary science]] at the University of Idaho; Kenneth L. White, Utah State University professor of animal science; and Dirk Vanderwall, University of Idaho assistant professor of animal and veterinary science. The baby mule, [[Idaho Gem]], was born May 4. It was the first clone of a hybrid animal. Veterinary examinations of the foal and its surrogate mother showed them to be in good health soon after birth. The foal's DNA comes from a fetal cell culture first established in 1998 at the University of Idaho.

The '''Alpaca''' (''Vicugna pacos'') is a species of [[South America]]n [[camelid]], similar to, and often confused with the [[llama]]. However, alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas. The two animals are closely related, and can successfully cross-breed. Alpacas and llamas are also closely related to the [[Vicuña]], which is believed to be the alpaca's wild ancestor, and to the [[Guanaco]]. 
There are two breeds of Alpaca: the {{illm|Suri alpaca|es|Suri (alpaca)}} and the [[Huacaya (alpaca)|Huacaya alpaca]].

Alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the [[Andes]] of Southern [[Peru]], Western [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], and Northern [[Chile]] at an altitude of {{convert|3500|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/v9384e/v9384e05.htm#1.4.3 |title=Harvesting of textile animal fibres|publisher = UN Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas, and unlike llamas, they were not bred to be working animals, but were bred specifically for their fiber. [[Alpaca fiber]] is used for making knitted and woven items, similar to [[wool]]. These items include blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a wide variety of textiles and [[poncho]]s in South America, and sweaters, socks, coats and bedding in other parts of the world. The fiber comes in more than 52 natural colors as classified in Peru, 12 as classified in Australia, and 16 as classified in the United States.

Alpacas communicate through body language. The most common is spitting when they are in distress, fearful, or mean to show dominance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alpaca – Lama pacos – Details |work=[[Encyclopedia of Life]] |url=http://www.eol.org/pages/309015/details}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male alpacas are more aggressive than females, and tend to establish dominance of their herd group. In some cases, alpha males will immobilize the head and neck of a weaker or challenging male in order to show their strength and dominance.

In [[Textile]] industry, "alpaca" primarily refers to the hair of Peruvian Alpacas, but more broadly it refers to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca hair, such as [[mohair]], [[Icelandic sheep]] wool, or even high-quality wool. In trade, distinctions are made between alpacas and the several styles of mohair and luster.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alpaca|volume=1|pages=721–722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adult alpaca generally is between {{convert|81|–|99|cm|in}} in height at the shoulders ([[withers]]). They usually weigh between {{convert|48|–|84|kg|lb}}.

==Background==
[[File:Guanako.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Guanacos]] (wild parent species of llamas) near [[Torres del Paine]], [[Chile]]]]

Alpacas have been domesticated for thousands of years. [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of Northern Peru often used alpaca images in their art.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]]''. New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no known docile wild alpacas, and its closest living relative, the ''[[vicuña]]'' (also native to [[South America]]),is believed to be the wild ancestor of the alpaca.

The family of Camelidaes first appeared in Americas 40–45 million years ago during the Eocene period from the common ancestor, [[Protylopus]]. The origin and evolution of the South American camelids. New Zealand Alpaca Associatiyears after the inhabitants divided into Camelini and Lamini tribes, taking different migratory patterns to Asia and South America respectively. Although the [[camelid]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s became extinct in North America around 3 million years ago, in the South flourished with the tribes we see today.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, J. L. (2001). ''Control of ovarian follicular growth in alpaca, lama pacos. ''(Unpublished PhD). Central Queensland University, Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt;  It wasn't until 2–5 million years ago, during the Pliocene that the genus [[Hemiauchenia]] of the tribe [[Lamini]] split into [[Palaeolama]] and Lama, the latter would then split again into Lama and Vicugna upon migrating down to South America.

Remains of [[Vicuña]] and [[Guanaco]] have been found throughout Peru for around 12,000 years. Their domesticated counterparts, the [[llama]] and alpacas have been found mummified in the Moquegua valley in the south of Peru dating back 900 to 1000 years. Mummies found in this region shows two breeds of alpacas. More precise analysis of bone and teeth of these mummies has demonstrated that alpacas were domesticated from the Vicugna vicugna. Other research, considering the behavioral and morphological characteristics of alpacas and their wild counterparts, seems to indicate that alpacas could find their origins in Lama guanicoe as well as Vicugna vicugna, or even a hybrid of both [[Mitochondrial DNA]] shows a different picture for the origins of the Alpaca. mtDNA research shows that Alpacas are descendants of the Vicugna vicugna, not of the Lama guanicoe. This has led to attempts to reclassify Alpaca to Vicugna pacos.

=== Breeds ===
Alpacas come in two breeds Suri and Huacaya, depending on its fiber rather than conventional or European classifications

Huacaya Alpacas are the most common found, about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2012"&gt;10.  Wheeler, J. (2012). South American camelids – past, present and future. '' Journal of Camelid Science,  5'', 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Huacaya alpaca is thought to be originated in post-colonial Peru. This is due to their thicker fleece which makes them more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the Andes after being pushed into the highlands of Peru when conquistadors arrived.&lt;ref name="Merrell2017"&gt;Merrell, J., &amp; Merrell, S. (2017). Huacaya alpacas. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.gatewayalpacas.com/alpacas/the-breed/huacaya.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2018}}

Suri alpacas represent a smaller portion of the total Alpaca population, around 10%.&lt;ref name="Wheeler2012" /&gt;  They are thought to have been more prevalent in pre-Columbian Peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece was not needed for extenuating weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Merrell2017" /&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2018}}

==Behavior==

[[File:Alpaca headshot.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Closeup of an alpaca's face]]

Alpacas are social herd animals that live in family groups, consisting of a territorial [[alpha male]], females, and their young ones. Alpacas warn the herd about intruders by making sharp, noisy inhalations that sound like a high-pitched bray. The herd may attack smaller predators with their front feet, and can spit and kick. Their aggression towards members of the [[Canidae|canid family]] ([[coyotes]], [[foxes]], [[dogs]] etc.) is exploited when alpacas are used as [[guard llama]]s for guarding sheep.&lt;ref name=iastate&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=W. L|last2=Powell|first2=K, J|title=Guard Llamas:  A part of integrated sheep protection|date=July 1994|publisher=Iowa State University|url=https://store.extension.iastate.edu/Product/pm1527-pdf|accessdate=12 February 2016|ref=Pm-1527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpacas can sometimes be aggressive, but they can also be very gentle, intelligent, and extremely observant. For the most part, alpacas are very quiet, but male alpacas are more energetic when they get involved in fighting with other alpacas.&lt;ref name="camelidynamics.com"&gt;Bennett, Marty McGee. (2010). CAMELIDynamics: Understanding Male Behavior in the Alpaca. Alpaca Magazine. Retrieved from https://www.camelidynamics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/HER10Undertandmalebehav.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; When they prey, they are cautious but also nervous when they feel any type of threat. They can feel threatened when a person or another alpaca comes up from behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Alpaca Behaviour. (n.d.). Retrieved November 16, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.alpacasociety.co.za/?q=node%2F8&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2018}}

Alpacas set their own boundaries of "personal space" within their families and groups.&lt;ref name="alpacaconsultingusa.com"&gt;Paul, Elizabeth. (2007). Alpaca Behaviour. Alpacas Australia, No. 52. Retrieved from https://www.alpacaconsultingusa.com/library/AA_AlpacaBehaviour.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; They make a [[hierarchy]] in some sense, and each alpaca is aware of the dominant animals in each group.&lt;ref name="camelidynamics.com"/&gt; Body language is the key to their communication. It helps to maintain their order. One example of their body communication includes a pose named broadside, where their ears are pulled back and they stand sideways. This pose is used when male alpacas are defending their territory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When they are young, they tend to follow larger objects and to sit near or under them. An example of this is a baby alpaca with its mother. This can also apply when an alpaca passes by an older alpaca.&lt;ref name="alpacaconsultingusa.com"/&gt;

===Spitting===
Not all alpacas spit, but all are capable of doing so. "Spit" is somewhat [[euphemism|euphemistic]]; occasionally the projectile contains only air and a little saliva, although alpacas commonly bring up acidic stomach contents (generally a green, grassy mix) and project it onto their chosen targets. Spitting is mostly reserved for other alpacas, but an alpaca will also occasionally spit at a human.

Spitting can result in what is called "sour mouth". Sour mouth is characterized by a loose-hanging lower lip and a gaping mouth.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Alpacas can spit for several reasons. A female alpaca spits when she's not interested in a male alpaca, typically when she thinks she's already impregnated. Both sexes of alpaca keep others away from their food, or anything they have their eyes on. Most give a slight warning before spitting by blowing air out and raising their heads, giving their ears a "pinned" appearance.&lt;ref name="alpacaconsultingusa.com"/&gt;

Alpacas can spit up to ten feet if they need to. For example, if another animal does not back off, the alpaca will throw up its stomach contents, resulting in a lot of spit.&lt;ref name="petpartners.org"&gt;Pet Partners. (December 2016). Llama- Alpaca Behavior Packet. Pet Partners, No. 2. Retrieved from https://petpartners.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Llama-Alpaca-Behavior-Packet.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some signs of stress which can lead to their spitting habits include: humming, a wrinkle under their eye, drooling, rapid breathing, and stomping their feet. When alpacas show any sign of interest or alertness, they tend to sniff their surroundings, watch closely, or stand quietly in place and stare.&lt;ref name="petpartners.org"/&gt;

When it comes to reproduction, they spit because it is a response triggered by the progesterone levels being increased, which is associated with ovulation.&lt;ref name="aaanswalpaca.com.au"&gt;Australian Alpaca Association. (2008). Alpaca Mating Fact Sheet, No. 2. Retrieved http://www.aaanswalpaca.com.au/pdf/AAAMatingFactSheet26Sep13A.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygiene===
Alpacas are generally very organized and neat. When they defecate they usually designate one place, even if they need to walk farther away. They use a communal dung pile.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Mystery Alpacas. Alpaca Behavior.http://www.northernmysteryalpacas.com/behaviour.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Their waste is collected and used as garden fertilizer or even natural fertilizer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another factor that goes into alpaca hygiene&lt;ref&gt;Dental Hygiene. (n.d.). Retrieved November 03, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.alpacasbythesea.com/pages/dental.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2018}} is their tooth care. When observing the teeth of an alpaca, it is a good way to tell if they have a healthy digestive system. Alpacas have their full set of adult teeth by the age of six. Male alpacas have 32 teeth and female alpacas have 30 teeth. Males have two extra teeth, called fighting teeth, but females only rarely have these. Alpacas have six lower incisors which help them bite off plants to chew. They do not have any upper incisors, but their mouths are lined up perfectly so that they have the ability to eat grass, hay, and plants.

There are warning signs to when an alpaca may have dental hygiene problems. One way to tell is if they take a while to chew their grass or hay or when they are eating, they continue to spill all their food and not keep it in their mouths. Another sign can be the poor body condition and if their cheeks are pushed in.

Alpacas use a communal dung pile, where they do not graze. This behaviour tends to limit the spread of internal parasites. Generally, males have much tidier, and fewer dung piles than females, which tend to stand in a line and all go at once. One female approaches the dung pile and begins to urinate and/or defecate, and the rest of the herd often follows.

Because of their preference for using a dung pile, some alpacas have been successfully house-trained.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

===Sounds===
[[File:Suri-alpaca.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Suri alpacas]]
Alpacas make a variety of sounds, including: 
* Humming: When alpacas are born, the mother and its child hum constantly. They also hum as a sign of distress, especially when they are separated from their herd. Alpacas may also hum if they are curious, happy, worried or cautious.
* Snorting: Alpacas snort when another alpaca is invading their space.
* Grumbling: Alpacas grumble to warn each other. For example, when one is invading another's personal space, it sounds like they are gurgling.
* Clucking: Similar to a hen’s cluck, alpacas cluck when a mother is concerned for her [[cria]]. Male alpacas will cluck to signal friendly behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Screaming: Their screams are extremely deafening and loud. They will scream when they are not handled correctly or when they are being attacked by a potential enemy.
* Screeching: A bird-like cry, presumably intended to terrify the opponent. This sound is typically used by a male alpaca when they are in a fight over who will dominate. When a female screeches, it is more of a growl when they are angry.

===Reproduction===
Females are [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]];&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J. Reprod. Fert.|year=1985|volume=74|issue=2|pages=335–339|title=Semen-induced ovulation in the bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus).|author=Chen, B.X. |author2=Yuen, Z.X. |author3=Pan, G.W. |last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=September 12, 2014|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/74/2/335.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the act of mating and the presence of semen causes them to ovulate. Females usually conceive after just one breeding, but occasionally do have trouble conceiving. Artificial insemination is technically difficult, expensive and not common, but it can be accomplished. Embryo transfer is more widespread.

A male is usually ready to mate for the first time between two and three years of age. It is not advisable to allow a young female to be bred until she is mature and has reached two-thirds of her mature weight. Over-breeding a young female before conception is possibly a common cause of uterine infections. As the age of maturation varies greatly between individuals, it is usually recommended that novice breeders wait until females are 18 months of age or older before initiating breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigmeadowcreekalpacas.com/About%20Alpacas/AlpacaReproduction.htm |title=Alpaca Reproduction |last1=LaLonde |first1=Judy |website=Big Meadow Creek Alpacas |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpacas can breed at any time but it is more difficult to breed in the winter. Most breed during autumn or late spring.&lt;ref name="thealpacaplace.co.nz"&gt;Mating &amp; Pregnancy.” ''The Alpaca Place'', The Alpaca Place, www.thealpacaplace.co.nz/articles/breeding-and-reproduction/mating-pregnancy/.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2018}} The most popular way to have alpacas mate is pen mating. Pen mating is when they move both the female and the desired male into a pen. Another way is paddock mating where one male alpaca is let loose in the paddock with several female alpacas.&lt;ref name="thealpacaplace.co.nz"/&gt;{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2018}}

The gestation period is, on an average, 11.5 months, and usually results in a single offspring, or ''[[cria]]''. [[Twins]] are rare, occurring about once per 1000 deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpacas.com/QnA/Breeding.aspx |title=Breeding and Birthing |website=Northwest Alpacas |accessdate=23 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721011914/http://www.alpacas.com/QnA/Breeding.aspx |archive-date=21 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cria are generally between 15 and 19 pounds, and are standing 30 to 90 minutes after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parrishillfarm.com/alpacas101.shtml |title=Alpacas 101 |website=Parris Hill Farms |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a female gives birth, she is generally [[receptive to breeding]] again after about two weeks. Crias may be weaned through human intervention at about six months old and 60 pounds, but many breeders prefer to allow the female to decide when to wean her offspring; they can be weaned earlier or later depending on their size and emotional maturity.

The average lifespan of an alpaca is between 15–20 years, and the longest-lived alpaca on record is 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alpacainfo.com/academy/about-alpacas |title=About Alpacas |website=Alpaca Owners Association Inc |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habitat and lifestyle ==
Alpacas can be found native all over South America. They typically live in temperate conditions in the mountains with high altitudes.

They are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment. Animals such as [[flamingo]]s, [[condor]]s, [[spectacled bear]]s, mountain lions, coyotes, llamas, and sheep live near alpacas when they are in their natural habitat.

== Population ==
Alpacas are native to Peru; it currently has the largest population of alpacas in the world. About half of the alpacas worldwide are in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22956/0 | title = Vicugna vicugna  | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T22956A9402796.en | work = RED List | publisher = International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources | quote = Country: Vicuña population Argentina: 127,072 or 72,678 Bolivia: 62,869 Chile: 16,942 Ecuador: 2,683 Peru: 188,327 TOTAL: 347,273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population declined drastically after the Spanish Conquistadors invaded the [[Andes|Andes mountains]] in 1532, after which 98% of the animals were destroyed. The Spanish also brought with them diseases that were fatal to alpacas.&lt;ref&gt;Alpaca History. (n.d.). Retrieved November 14, 2017 from, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://epicalpacas.com/alpaca-history/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the invasion, alpacas were forced to move higher into the mountains and remained there permanently. Although alpacas had almost been wiped out completely, they were rediscovered sometime during the 19th century by Europeans. After finding uses for them, the animals became important to societies during the industrial revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maple View Farm Alpacas. (n.d.). Retrieved November 14, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mapleviewfarmalpacas.com/learn-about-alpacas/alpaca-history/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, alpacas can be found all over the world, only excluding the Antarctic.

==Diet==
[[File:Alpaca-tobudobutsuen-2012.ogv|upright=1.2|thumb|(video) An Alpaca chewing]]
Alpacas chew their food which ends up being mixed with their [[cud]] and saliva and then they swallow it. They bring up the cud and chew it while they are resting, which is called [[regorgitating]]. Alpacas usually eat 1.5%&lt;ref&gt;An Overview of Alpaca Diet, Nutrition &amp; Care. (2014, December 8). Retrieved November 14, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ecolonomics.org/an-overview-of-alpaca-diet-nutrition-care/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of its body weight for normal growth. They mainly need pasture grass, hay, or [[silage]] but some may also need supplemental energy and protein foods and they will also normally try to chew on almost anything (e.g. empty bottle). Most alpaca ranchers rotate their feeding grounds so the grass can regrow and fecal parasites may die before reusing the area.  Pasture grass is a great source of protein. When seasons change, the grass loses or gains more protein. For example, in the spring, the pasture [[Pasture|grass]] has about 20% protein while in the summer, it only has 6%.&lt;ref&gt;An Overview of Alpaca Diet, Nutrition &amp; Care. (2014, December 8). Retrieved November 14, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ecolonomics.org/an-overview-of-alpaca-diet-nutrition-care/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They need more energy supplements in the winter to produce body heat and warmth. They get their fiber from hay or from long stems which provides them with vitamin E. Green grass contains vitamin A and E.

Alpacas can eat natural unfertilized grass; however, ranchers can also supplement grass with low-protein grass hay. To provide selenium and other necessary vitamins, ranchers will feed their domestic alpacas a daily dose of grain to provide additional nutrients that are not fully obtained from their primary diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpaca.com/alpacacareanddiet.cfm World's Premier Alpaca Resource and Marketplace I love alpacas and I love alpaca.com – Alpacas for Sale 1 866 ALPACAS]. Alpaca.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Alpacas may obtain the necessary vitamins in their native grazing ranges.

===Digestion===
Alpacas, like other camelids, have a three-chambered stomach; combined with chewing [[cud]], this three-chambered system allows maximum extraction of nutrients from low-quality forages. Alpacas are not ruminants, pseudo-ruminants, or modified ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, M.E. (2010). "Medicine and Surgery of Camelids", Ames, Iowa: Wiley-Blackwell. Chapter 1 General Biology and Evolution addresses the fact that camelids (including llamas and camels) are not ruminants, pseudo-ruminants, or modified ruminants.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpacas will chew their food in a figure eight motion, swallow the food, and then pass it into one of the stomach's chambers. The first and second chambers (called C1 and C2) are where the fermentation process begins. The alpaca will further absorb nutrients and water in the first part of the third chamber. The end of the third chamber (called C3) is where the stomach secretes acids to digest food, and is the likely place where an alpaca will have ulcers, if stressed.

===Poisonous plants===
Many plants are poisonous to the alpaca, including the [[Bracken|bracken fern]], [[fireweed]], [[Nerium oleander|oleander]], and some [[azalea]]s. In common with similar livestock, others include: [[acorn]]s, [[Rue|African rue]], [[agave]], [[amaryllis]], [[Crocus|autumn crocus]], [[Xerophyllum tenax|bear grass]], [[Gutierrezia sarothrae|broom snakeweed]], [[buckwheat]], [[ragweed]], [[Ranunculus|buttercups]], [[Zantedeschia|calla lily]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange tree]] foliage, [[Dianthus caryophyllus|carnations]], [[Castor oil plant|castor beans]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-r-alpacas.com/Alpaca%20Tips/plants_that_are_poisonous_to_alp.htm|title=Plants that are poisonous to alpacas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the scientific name==

The relationship between alpacas and vicuñas was disputed for many years. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the four South American [[lamoid]] species were assigned scientific names. At that time, the alpaca was assumed to be descended from the [[llama]], ignoring similarities in size, fleece and dentition between the alpaca and the [[Vicugna vicugna|vicuña]]. Classification was complicated by the fact that all four species of South American camelid can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=Jane C.|title=South American camelids – past, present and future|journal=Journal of Camelid Science|date=2012|volume=5|page=13|url=http://www.isocard.net/images/journal//FILE486198178b052d8.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[DNA]] technology made a more accurate classification possible.

In 2001, the alpaca genus classification changed from ''Lama pacos'' to ''Vicugna pacos'', following the presentation of a paper&lt;ref name=wheeler&gt;{{cite journal|first =Dr Jane|last =Wheeler|author2=Miranda Kadwell |author3=Matilde Fernandez |author4=Helen F.

Alpaca fleece is a lustrous and silky [[natural fiber|natural]] [[fiber]]. While similar to [[sheep|sheep’s]] wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and bears no [[lanolin]], which makes it [[hypoallergenic]].&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;Quiggle, Charlotte. "Alpaca: An Ancient Luxury." ''Interweave Knits'' Fall 2000: 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoller"&gt;Stoller, Debbie, ''Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet'', New York: Workman, 2006, p.{{nbsp}}18.&lt;/ref&gt; Without lanolin, it does not repel water. It is also soft and luxurious. In physical structure, alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair, being very glossy.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The preparing, [[carding]], [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[weaving]] and finishing process of alpaca is very similar to [[Textile manufacturing|the process used for wool]]. Alpaca fiber is also flame-resistant, and meets the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpacainfo.com/Fiber/info.asp|title=Error 404|website=www.alpacainfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpacas are typically sheared once per year in the spring. Each shearing produces approximately five to ten pounds (2.2–4.5 kilograms) of fiber per alpaca. An adult alpaca might produce 50 to 90 ounces (1420–2550 grams) of first-quality fiber as well as 50 to 100 ounces (1420–2840 grams) of second- and third-quality fiber. The quality of alpaca fiber is determined by how crimpy it is. Typically, the greater the number of small folds in the fiber, the greater the quality.

Knitting with commercially spun alpaca fiber is easy since it is very soft, and no more slippery than sheep's wool. (It is slightly harder to spin by hand because it lacks the large scales of sheep wool and thus doesn't twist together quite as well.) Alpaca yarn has become very popular with hand-knitters in the United States in the last decade. Handmade alpaca (and alpaca blend) garments made for sale are very common, especially in Peru and Bolivia. In Peru, there are two upscale companies that sell the majority of machine-made alpaca sweaters, scarves, ponchos, etc., as well as many other smaller companies in both countries that produce machine-made alpaca garments, generally for the tourist market. For production knitting there is a technique used with alpaca (or wool) yarn, between hand- and machine-made, that of 'hand-loomed.' This term means that the garment was made on a rather low-tech knitting 'machine' (such as the old Brother brand) where every stitch must be hooked up by hand in the proper color. Then the carriage is passed along the whole width of the garment, effectively joining the stitches to those below or knitting them. Many tourist-destined sweaters, scarves and so forth in South American shops are made by this method. Hand-looming obviously necessitates a relatively expensive machine, so caps, sweaters, and shawls are more commonly made entirely by hand, with two knitting needles or a circular needle or 4-5 double-pointed needles for socks. Weaving with alpaca is done by many indigenous groups around the Cuzco region of Peru, creating fine, strong shawls and so forth with a nice drape. Alpaca garments can last for an extremely long time, but beware as clothes moths seem to adore the fiber. As the fiber is soft and luxurious it is the choice of some high end alpaca knitwear and sweater companies.

==Prices==
The price for American Alpacas can range from US$50 for a castrated male (gelding) to US$500,000 for the highest in the world, depending on breeding history, sex, and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to an academic study,&lt;ref name="DARE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alpaca Lies? Do Alpacas Represent the Latest Speculative Bubble in Agriculture?|url=http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research1/alpaca_RAE.pdf|publisher=[[University of California, Davis]]|author1=Tina L. Saitone |author2=Richard J. Sexton|year=2005|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though, the higher prices sought for alpaca breeding stock are largely speculative and not supported by market fundamentals, given the low inherent returns per head from the main end product, [[alpaca fiber]], and prices into the $100s per head rather than $10,000s would be required for a commercially viable fiber production herd.&lt;ref name="Tuckwell"&gt;Alpacas: A handbook for Farmers and Investors; Tuckwell RIRDC 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding stock prices in Australia have fallen from A$10,000–30,000 head in 1997 to an average of A$3,000–4,000 today{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

It is possible to raise up to 25 alpacas per [[hectare]] (10 alpacas per [[acre]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarloafalpacas.com/faqs.shtml|title=FAQs – Sugarloaf Alpaca Company – Adamstown, MD|website=www.sugarloafalpacas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they have a designated area for waste products and keep their eating area away from their waste area.  However,  this ratio differs from country to country and is highly dependent on the quality of pasture available (in many desert locations it is generally only possible to run one to three animals per acre due to lack of suitable vegetation). Fiber quality is the primary variant in the price achieved for alpaca wool; in Australia, it is common to classify the fiber by the thickness of the individual hairs and by the amount of vegetable matter contained in the supplied shearings.

==Livestock==
[[Image:Bolivian Alpaca.jpg|thumb|A Bolivian man and his alpaca]]
Alpacas need to eat 1–2% of body weight per day, so about two {{convert|60|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bales of grass hay per month per animal. When formulating a proper diet for alpacas, water and hay analysis should be performed to determine the proper vitamin and mineral supplementation program. Two options are to provide free choice salt/mineral powder, or feed a specially formulated ration. Indigenous to the highest regions of the [[Andes]], this harsh environment has created an extremely hardy animal, so only minimal housing and predator fencing are needed.&lt;ref name=owners&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alpacainfo.com/about/index.asp|title=Error 404|website=www.alpacainfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alpaca’s three-chambered stomachs allow for extremely efficient digestion. There are no viable seeds in the manure, because alpacas prefer to only eat tender plant leaves, and will not consume thick plant stems; therefore, alpaca manure does not need composting to enrich pastures or ornamental landscaping. Nail and teeth trimming is needed every six to twelve months, along with annual shearing.

Similar to ruminants, such as cattle and sheep, alpacas have only lower teeth at the front of their mouths; therefore, they do not pull grass up by the roots. Rotating pastures is still important, though, as alpacas have a tendency to regraze an area repeatedly. Alpacas are fiber-producing animals; they do not need to be slaughtered to reap their product, and their fiber is a [[renewable resource]] that grows yearly.

== Cultural presence ==
Alpacas are closely tied to cultural practices for Andeans people. Prior to colonization, the image of the alpaca was used in rituals and in their religious practices. Since the people in the region depended heavily on these animals for their sustenance, the alpaca was seen as a gift from [[Pachamama]]. Alpacas were used for their meat, fibers for clothing, and art, and their images in the form of conopas.

Conopas take their appearance from the Suri alpacas, with long locks flanking their sides and bangs covering the eyes, and a depression on the back. This depression is used in ritual practices, usually filled with coca leaves and fat from alpacas and lamas, to bring fertility and luck. While their use was prevalent before colonization, the attempts to convert the Andean people to Catholicism led to the acquisition of more than 3,400 conopas in Lima alone.

The origin of alpaca is depicted in legend; the legend states they came to be in the world after a goddess fell in love with a man. The goddess’ father only allowed her to be with her lover if he cared for her herd of alpacas. On top of caring for the herd, he was to always carry a small animal for his entire life. As the goddess came into our world, the alpacas followed her. Everything was fine until the man set the small animal down, and the goddess fled back to her home. On her way back home, the man attempted to stop her and her herd from fleeing. While he was not able to stop her from returning, he was able to stop a few alpacas from returning. These alpacas who didn’t make it back are seen today in the swampy lands in the Andes waiting for the end of world, so they may return to their goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Merrell, J., &amp; Merrell, S. (2017). Conopas. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.gatewayalpacas.com/alpacas/history-of-alpacas/conopas.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
